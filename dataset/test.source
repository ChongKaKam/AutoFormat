noah : hi there ! the quince we talked about the other day ... are you still interested ? sophie : hello noah , but of course i am.thank you . noah : actually william went to collect the rest of them for you immediately . they 're in a basket on our terrace , so you call collect them any time . sophie : that 's very very kind of him ! he 's really a darling . sophie : we wo n't be going your direction any time soon i 'm afraid . how long will they keep ? is it windfall ? noah : both really but they all look very healthy . no bruises afa one can see . or only odd small ones . they ' be alright for a couple of days i guess . the weather 's cool . sophie : it would be a shame if they rotted . i 'll talk to frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap . noah : ok. sophie : hey noah , the twins will be on their way from notts tomorrow afternoon and passing windfield . is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince ? noah : absolutely ! in fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace . of course it would be great to see your twins again . have n't seen them for ages ! sophie : well we do n't see that much of them either they 'll be coming home this weekend only because of alexa 's ceremony . noah : notts is 3 hours ' drive away so small wonder they do n't fancy it so much . sophie : i do n't blame them ! we 're both happy they 've been doing fine at college . everything 's absolutely fine . you do n't have william at home all that often either , do you ? noah : he gets 5 days at xmas by way of `` family care '' and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days . they have a strict regime at the academy . but after all these years we 've learned to cope with it . what worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own . sophie : the fate of most military i guess . hugely unfair i 'd say . like being married to your regiment ! noah : that 's what it sounds like when he talks about himself ! i never hear a girl 's name ! and when i ask , he gets brusque . sophie : oh dear ! what could it mean ? noah : no , not what you think ! we know from capt . broomsberg about their common escapades . plenty of women but only that sort of women . no strings . sophie : i never even imagined he might be gay ! surely not . but there must be sth else . noah : we think he 's just so obsessively career-minded . nothing else counts for him . sophie : he 's always been very strong-willed . and he knows what he wants . well if i were you i would n't worry at all . noah : you 're probably right . but you know i 'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me . sophie : they 'll come , do n't you worry ! look the twins will contact you about the quince . alright ? noah : sure . thank you sophie for a nice chat ! sophie : thank you for the quince !

andy : hello . i have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room . betty : hello andy . thank you for that , what are your thoughts ? andy : i think it is caused by condensation , as most of the moist settles on and around the windows . betty : why is that ? andy : those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water . on the windows its just water , on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow . betty : so why is it all over the spare room walls , and all around the dining room ? but not in other rooms ? andy : probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls . betty : so why only that bedroom and not the other ones ? andy : i guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen . betty : but why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then ? andy : i think that is because the kitchen does n't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it . the difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees . betty : does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation ? andy : not necessarily . that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house , so it would just settle somewhere else . betty : so what would you recommend ? andy : i would install a fan system , or piv system , which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air . it would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night . betty : that sounds good . would that be sufficient ? andy : if you buy a decent size it will be , but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould . that will not go away by itself . betty : ok , is this something your company can help with ? andy : it is indeed , we can repaint as well if you want . betty : good point . could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email ? andy : of course , i will have that done by friday . betty : that would be great . and again , thanks for today ! andy : no problem , speak soon .

sean : friendly reminder of trade deadline today . let 's get those last minute trade request sent . rick : so does john get lamar jackson or is he scrambling for another qb ? ? sean : nick needs to really think about rolling with blake . john needs a qb ! john : i think i would have rights to lamar but i think the consensus is that he 's on waivers so he 's open . i guess i 'm just hoping rgiii and brock play or just wait ... rick : crazy it happens though ! he one thing in the chart that is n't addressed . we could vote and go from there . i just want you to lose a player and nick not to get lamar . john : in 15 years i 've never seen a ream trade a big time rb or wr for a qb this late n the season do anything in the playoffs . that ends their season . of course a one qb team is n't worth anything either . i have t take my chances . sean : damned if you do , damned if you do n't . rick : people 's evidence # 658 why the qb rule does n't work . john : i might have a way to drop the rule completely next year . sean : i guess we will have to talk about after the season . rick : nobody liked my ir suggestion a couple of years ago . that solves a large percentage of the issue tho sean : 1 qb not 2 for a 14 league ... john : as i said , we can look at if after the season . i just would n't want to make it any easier . what has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far .

charles : how can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance ? karen : you can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten . from what i 've heard , being allergic is far worse , because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal , while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms , but i do n't think may lead to your death jack : why are you asking ? is there something wrong ? charles : hm , i do n't know , i feel that i may be allergic or something monica : do you have any symptoms ? check those articles : monica : , karen : i think that you may have a very very light allergy at best , otherwise you would have known - trust me karen : when it comes to intolerance ... i know it 's very hip to be gluten intolerant , but i do n't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant . unless you have a coeliac disease , i think you 're fine jack : my friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she 's absolutely fine charles : i may do it as well . i feel weird recently , bloated and i gain weight even though i do n't eat much karen : but do you feel differently after eating gluten ? jack 's right , you should do a blood test first , but you can test it yourself . stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better monica : i did the same thing with lactose , i was n't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk , etc . i stopped eating it and i 'm much better now jack : but did it happen suddenly or were you always like this ? monica : it just happened , i was all right until i was n't . i do n't know how it works , but it happens charles : i think it 's the same with me . i was fine , but recently it 's a real nightmare karen : you should quit eating gluten and see , otherwise you should look for a different explanation . maybe it has nothing to do with food ? charles : i had a basic blood test and everything 's fine . my gp said all my problems are linked to my diet karen : it may be , but i 'm not so sure . although , changing your diet and eating healthier ca n't do you any harm monica : you should read the articles i sent you , check the symptoms and what you should n't eat charles : thanks ! i 'm really worried , because it 's getting worse and i have no idea what 's happening with me
