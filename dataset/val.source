michaela : so what do you guys think about the association idea ? ron : i might be lacking the context here michaela : basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association , so it 's easier to get funds for events for example jessie : i 'm torn actually - i get why it would help with funds , cooperation with other institutions and such , but i researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork . steve : and someone to take care of it permanently , cause it does n't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year . michaela : these are exactly the kind of things that i wanted to discuss with you . do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork ? does n't have to be one person . steve : frankly , i do n't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs , barely have time for meetings sometimes and it 's a ton of responsibility ron : the question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it ? there are also some financial costs , are there ? michaela : yeah , like a small fee when you set it up , but nothing more really . jessie : so what do we get from it really ? michaela : maybe the cost of a rubber stamp . michaela : for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year , but to apply you need to be a formal association ron : and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us , because we were n't an association jessie : i think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually michaela : i recall two as well steve : but do we truly need those subsidies ? we 've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it , just with collective effort . steve : i 'm just afraid we 're gon na lose this sense of an informal get-together , it 's all just gon na turn into a business and will create tensions between us . i 've seen it happen to clubs like ours ron : it 's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding michaela : association is not a business , we 're not gon na start selling things . it 's just about access to the possibilities that 's we 're denied right now cause we 're not a formal association jessie : well ... i could help out with the paperwork , but not alone . i 'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work michaela : as this was my idea , i can help too , just a matter of dividing our work properly ron : i ca n't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that 's been going on , so i wo n't be able to help , buy if y'all agree it 's a good idea , i 'm going to support it michaela : steve ? steve : i do n't know man , i like things the way they are right now michaela : ok , maybe it 's better to talk about this in person . is monday after the meeting ok for you all ? steve : yup , i can stay a bit longer jessie : fine by me ron : as well
