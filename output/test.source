Lenny: Babe, can you help me with something? Which one should i pick?    But i already have purple trousers. Does it make sense to have two pairs? Yeah, but shouldn't i pick a different color? So i guessi'll buy the first or the third pair then. Ur right, thx. Bob: Sure, what's up? Send me photos. I like the first ones best. I have four black.

Ollie: Hi, are you in warsaw. Nope! Nope, we have this party and you must be there, remember? We have lunch this week? Friday? What ! !! Oh oh ... very strange!

Jane: Yes, just back! Btw are you free for diner the 19th? And the 18th? Oh right! I lost my calendar .. thanks for reminding me. With pleasure! Ok. What do you mean `` we don't have any more whisky ! '' lol .. You just call me and the all thing i heard was that sentence about whisky ... what's wrong with you? Dont ' worry, we'll check on friday. I can't wait to be in morocco .. Sorry ollie, i'm very busy, i won't have time for lunch tomorrow, but may be at 6pm after my courses? This trip to morocco was so nice, but time consuming! I'm on my way .. I already ate them all ... see you in a minute.
Elliot: I'm ok. we're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and i guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?  Sounds like a plan. See you at 2 then xx. Benjamin: Hey guys, what are we doing with the keys today? Hmm i might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday. Yaaaawn where and where are you meeting? Interesting to be honest, hilary, i almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear. All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take. Hilary: I've got them. Whoever wants them can meet me at lunchtime or after. Yeah, i guess so. Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some french people ( the ones who work on the history of food in colonial mexico - i already see you yawning your head off ). Soi'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called la cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen. Oh come on. We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. Oh wait, no, i'm actually meeting them because i wanted to chat about their research lol. Do join us, we're going to have fun. And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps.  Daniel: I'm with hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me.
Payton: Sure. Yeah, but they have different things so i usually buy things from 2 or 3 of them. No problem. What about me? Yes and no. I like browsing, trying on, looking in the mirror and seeing how i look, but not always buying. Isn't it obvious ? ; ). If i bought everything i liked, i'd have nothing left to live on ; ). Lol. Well, i have 2 things i must struggle to resist! Clothes, ofc ; ). Books. I absolutely love reading! Everything i can get my hands on. Yup. Max: Know any good sites to buy clothes from? That's a lot of them! I'll check them out. Thanks. How about u? Do u like shopping? How come? Y not? Sry ; ). Same here, but probably different category ; ). So what do u usually buy? Which are? Right. And the second one? Gr8! What books do u read? Srsly?
Rita: I'm so bloody tired. Falling asleep at work. The time just keeps on dragging on and on and on .... I keep on looking at the clock and there's still 4 hours of this drudgery to go. I'm really not cut out for this level of boredom. Tina: I know what you mean. I keep on nodding off at my keyboard hoping that the boss doesn't notice .. Times like these i really hate my work. Neither am i .
Leo: No, thanks. Because i don't need it. I don't like them. How understanding of you! Eh . Beatrice: I am in town, shopping. They have nice scarfs in the shop next to the church. Do you want one? But you don't have a scarf. Last winter you had a cold all the time. A scarf could help. Actually, i don't care. You will get a scarf. You were complaining the whole winter that you're going to die. I've had enough.

Ethan: Somethin for scott. Xd. Toby: Haha, totally. Oh we know honey bunny. Scott: You know you're exactly fuckin the same. Oh fucky'all toby :. Marshall: Pretty much sums it up. We just enjoy making fun of you.
John: It's pretty irresponsible to give that much work to someone on their notice period. It's up to you, but you know what they say ... Well, they say how you end things shows how you really are ... Gotcha! It's only two weeks left, so grit your teeth and do what you have to do. Come on, stop thinking, start doing! Igor: Shit, i've got so much to do at work andi'm so demotivated. Yeah, exactly! Should i even care? What do you mean? And now how you start, right? So what shall i do then? Easy to say, hard to perform. That's so typical of you ! ; ).
Neela: Not much, chilling out. Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good? Why is it called dear white people? Yeah, but why is it so good? I suppose it's rather different from the uk, then? How's that? Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens? Well, i must say, it does sound good, i'll check it out soon! Well, thanks clara, i'm just watching the rest of a movie andi'll try dear white people. See ya, love! Clara: Hi, what you up to? Just rewatching dear white people on netflix, love it! Well, yes! I just said it was, lol. It's about a fictional ivy league university and the students in one house of residence. That's the name of the radio show the main character, sam, presents on college radio. Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which i find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too. It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand. Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, i'm not sure of that. Well, there is a young black guy called lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies. Definitely, there is supposed to be a series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it! Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4! Bye !
Mike: No, took it into garage today. Why? Lol lucky me. Ernest: Hey mike, did you park your car on our street? Ok good. Someone just crashed into a red honda looking just like yours.
Beth: Hi auntie deirdre, i'm been meaning to message you, had a favour to ask. How about a girls weekend, just mum, me, you and the girls, kira will have to come back from uni, of course. Oh yeah, we had a surprise party for you, you nearly had a heart attack! Oh, it was just that i fancied trying a bit of work experience in the salon, auntie. I know, but it's not for me, auntie, i am doing all foundation papers andi'm struggling with those. Maybe, buti'd like to try working. I'm 16 soon, i'm old enough. Yes, thanks auntie. I'd really like to try the beauty therapy side. Oh yes, i was chatting to a friend about it yesterday! Yes, i'd really like that. Ok, i like the sound of it! See you tomorrow auntie! Love you! Deirdre: Hi beth, how are you love? Wondered if you had any thought about your mum's 40th, we've got to do something special! Sounds fab! Get your thinking cap on, it's only in 6 weeks! Bet she's dreading it, i remember doing that! Well, it was a lovely surprise! Gosh, thats nearly 4 years ago now, time flies! What was the favour, darling? Well, i am looking for saturday girls, are you sure about it? You could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form. What about a tutor? Kira could help you in the hols. I know. Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat. Its not for the squeamish, mind. Massage, pedicures, not to mention waxing! Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes. We can try a few hours on a saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. If you like, we'll take it from there. Bye, lovely girl! Xx.
Gloria: This exam is a bit of a lottery in fact. You can't really get prepared, it's all about experience. You can see some texts from previous years.  Yes it's very good. Actually it's good to read all the texts because you will see that some phrases repeat very often. Well it has to be. Would be perfect to have 2 more hours ... but on the other hand it would be really exhausting emma : 4 hours and no breaks? No breaks : / so it's really important to be really focused and try to write as fast as you can. And read it carefully and correct during the last hour. Emma: But there are some rules and some typical texts right? Wow that's very useful. I have never seen this site. How much time do you have for all 4 parts? Gloria : 4 hours. Is it enough? I'm going to read everything from that website, it's great.
Adam: Have you talked to may? I just talked to her and i must admit i worry about her. No wonder ... She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression. She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat. I was wondering how i can help her. Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone. Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name. Thank you karen ! Karen: Yes, yesterday, why? Me too, i suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn't very happy about it. I know, but i think this is serious. She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true. Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don't what to tell you. Honestly i don't know if we can help her, adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues andi'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse. Hm ... i don't know ... how about i call someone for advice? So we could know what to do. Of course i won't! I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. I'll let you know.
Anne: You were right, he was lying to me : /. Yeah, he told me he's 30, today i saw his passport - he's 40. He lied to me irene. Irene: Oh no, what happened? You sure it's so important? Jane: Who? That mark guy?
Darlene: Yay, a party! Cool with me. We can shred some papers at the party. Walk, ask him if he really wnts it and if he yes then we get it. But better ask him twice. And sure ask ab the party ! Walker: He mentioned paper shredder once. He did really. For no reason at all. I heard him say that. Wasn ; t drunk. Me neither. Will do augustine : 2moro ok? Heather: Yay! Crap we need to buy him a present. Whatever that make him happy. Srsly guys, you mean we should really get office equipment ? ?? Augustine: Guys, remember it's wharton's bday next week? Wtf ? !? So much fun.
Mickey: C'mon! Nah, i'm sure they look rly nice. Certainly! Y? Wtf ?! Y would ppl even do that? Listen, guys, fun talking to u, bt got ta go. Jessica: Yeah! What's yours? Faces? What faces? Well, ollie, ur turn! Bt y? Idk. Idc. Never. Going. There. Bt not the scariest! Bye! Kelly: Me? I don't wan na. Fine. It's a sculpture garden in finnland. It's not the sculptures, it's the amount of them and their faces! Well, they resemble ppl in different activities like hugging, training, doing sport and so on. But the faces are just morbid and there's like a hundred of them. All staring at you! Creepy ah! Yeah, me too. Bye! Ollie: Okay, kelly! Ur up nxt! What's scary about sculptures? Wait! Do they resemble vampires and stuff? Another one? Nagoro village in japan! Well, maybe it's not scary, but it similar to kelly's place. It's just creepy as hell. Imagine a village with ppl living in it. And in the same village u have these human-sized figures. And there's more of them than the ppl that actually live there! See! Mine was the worst! Point taken. Cu !
Selah: I can't see the phone number very well. Rewrite it plz. The phone of that person is off. Myah:  
Bella: No no ! !! He wasn't angry at all .. he actually appreciated on our brave deccision to dismiss the request of client .. Yeah he really did .. i too was astounded by his reaction ... What he told me was that he was looking forward to bring in new clients which were our current client's competitor .. Hahaha blessing in disguise xd. Eric: Hey bella, what happened today in boss's room ?? Was he angry ?? Really !! He appreciated this decision .. What could possibly lead to this ?? I mean, they were potential clients ... Oh that could possibly be the reason.well anyways you got appreciation xd congo.
Ben: Where are you? Why? Good idea. Around 4.30 pm. Right, we will see. Sure. Sleep well. Emma: At the rare of the bus. There are some free seats here. So i can have a nap even. When are we going to arrive to ny? If traffic is not crazy. Could you come here and wake me up around 4.15? Thanks! I'll try.
Jesse: I have an idea that'll cheer u up! I was thinking about doing something 4 the less fortunate this year. U'll get ur presents, no worries ; ). Well, have u heard about the refuge? That's right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and i thought that we could choose one and chip in. Have a look at these 3. Actually, i'm in for the 3rd one. So it's settled? Lee: Gr8 idea! Anything in mind? No. What's that? Count me in! I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange. Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. Sure. Maxine: So no presents 4 me? Phew! Was getting a bit worried for a moment ; ). I thinki've heard of them. So what about them? Me too. Agree. I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it. Fine . Lists:  Melvin: What is it? Bt what do u have in store? That's the christmas foundation to help women and children? That's a great idea! What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage. But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. Yup.

And i sucked at the airport, they've kept us one hour in the plane and finallyi'll catch the evening flight back home. Could you imagine? And you know, this way we had such a talkative pilot. The meeting? Sure, let me know how did it go. Ala: Oh yes, i know, that's for purpose. It's how it's suppose to be. They pay a lot of attention to the image. Oh, poor you. Pfff. Andi'm on my way to a meeting. Yes, keep your finger crossed. Ok darling, in touch.
Did: D. Sebastian: It's been already a year since we moved here. This is totally the best time of my life. Yeah! Totally maaan. During this 1 year i learned more than ever. I learned how to be resourceful, i'm learning responsibility, and i literally have the power to make my dreams come true. Exactly! That's another part of my life that is going great. Don't worry about it. I have a feeling this day will come shortly. This one year proved to me that when you want something really badly, you can achieve it. If you devoted your life to analyze all of the winning numbers, and with your math skills you could win. Something like that xd. Thanks. It means a lot my friend. Kevin: Really? It's great to hear that. It's great that you are satisfied with your decisions. And above all it's great to see that you have someone you love by your side. I wish i had such a person by my side.

Kate: At long last! Started to worry. Nothing new happening, if you disregard all that xmas craze. Momo has recovered from her injury and frolicking again.  Good old momo! Yes, it is your scarf! Too late. Momo thinks it belongs to her now. Get yourself a new one. They surely have nice ones there. Wait a sec!  Isn't it similar ?! Mum would probably like it. Why don't you? And if you go to some boutique shop or something? Not at a market as in your pics? Not really. And mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic cuban blouse ). Take care ! Ola: Hello kate, sorry for not keeping in touch properly. As expected, we have hardly any connectivity here in cuba. But we're doing fine and enjoying our trip. How are the things at home? No ! !! It's one of my favorites! The one from laos! Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs.  Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually crappy. I might try and find some. Would you like one too? Oki'll have a look. Greets to everyone at home pls.

Being pregnant, suffering because of this etc. Being obligated to be with the . 24h. Men have only sex and they wait for kids while women suffer. I wish i could do the same. Then probably i would say the same like u. Physical suffering. No one can do anything with this. I wish i could just have sex and wait for a baby while having a normal life. Not getting fat, having the same body, the same breast and not disgusting ... not feeling sick, not having pain, being able to do every day stuff even like walking ... I wasi'm a store, behind me there was a pregnant woman, she dropped some money and she couldn't even take them from the floor ... i had to help her. I hope that maybe soon they will be possible to have a child without being pregnant. Yes! And she's suffering. While a man is doing his normal stuff. U mean the conversation? Would be awesome.

Tom: Now? Ben: Ok. Mike: Let's go for a beer. Yes.
It: O. Samantha:  Wow, that's creepy as hell. What did you do? Whaaaat? I googled people out before, but i ’ m not that stupid ( and creepy ) to tell them about. Looooool. Men are fckin weird. Girl, you're lucky that he didn ’ t kill you, what a psycho. I would totally freak out. Leah: I've just met the creepiest guy on the earth : | samantha :: Oi'm all ears. Last night i went to the poetry reading. This guy approached me, introduced himself and we started talking. He was rly boring, but, you know, i didn't want to be rude, he didn't seem to be a psycho, so i kept talkig to him. At one point he mentioned that `` we have something in common '', because we both speak german. I was like : `` erm, ok, how do you know about this, i don't know you, i didn't tell you about this ''. He just brushed it off and kept talking. At one point he asked me about an event i had attended and he named all of my friends that had come with me. Of course i didn't tell him about it. I asked him once again how did he know about all this stuff and he said that he googled me out. Right ?! And now the best part. He googled me out, because he thought that i had a crush on him, because 2 weeks earlier i liked a post on fb announcing that he was going to accompany poets on the guitar during the poetry reading. Can you believe this ?! And he tried to walk me home, even though i told him straightforward that he was a creep. Charming: D.
Dave: Hey, is nicky still at your place? Her phone is off. Thanks ! Sam: She just left.

Simon: Not really, anything important? I'll be free at 5. Adrian: Can you talk? Not that much. I'll you then.
Jen: I thinki'm through with the dickhead. He's being a pain again. I'm going to tell him to move out. No. He's freeloading and said he has no intention of giving back my money because i don't deserve it with the way i act. I've learnt to hate him with a passion. He's like vermin that you can't cull. Abusive, nasty, annoying, irresponsible. He disgusts me. Yeah you were absolutely right .. as always. I seem to pick them, don't i? Sometimes i think it is my fault. If only i could be a better person, if only, if only .... What if he doesn't leave? I'm afraid of asking him to leave'cause it will only cause another fight. Yeah, you're right ... but how do i get out of this mess? Easier said than done. Yeah you're right. Sometimes i just don't have the strength. Jane: Did he at least give you back the money he owes you? He has a nerve doesn't he? How dare he ? ! !! Get rid of him! I told you right from the beginning that he's no good. I hate to say it but i can smell a fucktard a mile away. You know that way of thinking will get you nowhere fast. It's self defeating. That's what the abusers want you think that you're bad and you deserve every bit of abuse that they dish out. You can't spend your whole life walking on eggshells. I think you've got to cut your losses and just move on. I know. You've got ta do it hon. If you don't things will only get worse. Think of how much worse they've already got since you met him. I believe in you. Please do it! Rememberi'm always there for you .
Tonight: D. Dean: Hey sweetheart. What's for dinner. What do you mean you. Nooo whyyi'm starving. I guess i will! What would you like me to get for you ? : *. You won't? What's up?

Yeah i won't. Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow. Not telling dean :: O. Because it's a secret poppy :: O dean :: O poppy :: O. Dunno: D.

Andrew: Hello bez, this morning i wanted to take your car and go to krizingen but it showed `` low brake fluid level ''. So i went only to the garage next to willig and they said it's ok, probably a display error. Do you want me to have the car checked properly? Have you got a contract with some garage in particular?

Interesting: D especially the last point ^^. Me: D. Brooklyn: Same to you! Have you made any new year's resolutions ? ; >. Really ?: D so how you're going to change your life this year? Hmm,. Yeah, just one - not to make any resolutions. I just don't believe that a new year means a fresh start. Every past year i told myself i would lose weight, quit smoking, start going to the gym etc. Andi'm still a fatty, who smokes like a chimney and rarely leaves their couch. Well, you haven't convinced me. Nevertheless good luck with all your resolutions . ; ). Hannah: Happy new year ! ! ! ) ). A whole list ^^. New year, new. First, i'm gon na lose weight and exercise everyday ( or at least 3 times a week ). Second, i want to learn how to cook and start meal prepping. Finally, i'm gon na find my future husband ( or at least start using dating apps ): D. And you? Have you set any goals for 2019? Whyyyy ?? You're a little ray of sunshine, aren't you ? ; ) brooklyn :: P and you're an undaunted optimist. What makes you believe that everything is going to change for the better? I don't know, i just like to think that we get numerous second chances to change our lives, to make right what's wrong. That's it, i don't have any better explanation. Thanks ! : *.
Unbelieveable: Bloody idiot. What then? Trevor: I've got a bit of a problem, uncle. Yes, uncle i need to get you advice on how to break this to dad. That's the long and short of it, uncle. Well, it's her father's fault, uncle. Yes, uncle. She has sneaked me into the house really quietly and we are in her bedroom doing it. And we haven't got any condoms so i am planning to pull out at the last moment. So i am just pulling out and all of a sudden in bursts her father and delivers me such a kick up the arse that i am back in there coming. Yes. Richard: Have you, trevor? You haven't gone and got that abigail up the duff have you? Shit. How did that happen? Her father's fault? And him a church pastor? Fucking hell. Do go on.  So you say it is all his fault, then? Incredible. So maybe we can get him to pay the child support instead of you then, eh ?
Gail: So do i. but this doesn't meani'm addicted. I certainly do. And i like to spy on ppl. Yeah! It's a lot of fun! Like i was spying on em and turns out she's into some guy from work ; ). I know! And jessica is thinking about going on diet. Nah. Whenever she posts a lot of fitness-related stuff, she's just thinking about, but doing nothing rly. Nah. That's just how she is. The more she posts, the less she does. Like she had a phase for animal shelters. Remember? Right. And turned out that was everything she did. Never visited one. Never donated a dime. Never did anything. U see? Spying on ppl is fun. No, y would i? Oh no! Don't get me wrong! We talk all the time, so no need to spy on u ; ). Besides ur pretty straightforward.

I know ! Julia: I mean i like my instagram. And my snapchat. Oh and twitter. And sometimes facebook. Neither am i. i like looking at photos of my friends and sharing stuff with them.

In everything. I've had so much pleasure that i have a headache. Haha, i agree ! Kate: What's his name? Is he english? What does he do in london? Of course, so predictable. But?

And the only studiesi'm interested in are african studies buti'm not sure i can make big money later on haha except for working in the embassy or something like that. I was thinking about working as a flight attendant. It would be easy for me to get that job since i can swim ( and here it's obligatory ) i'm even a water rescuer. I know english italian and polish and a bit of german. But to be honest, i don't think so that job is so great. I can't work there forever andi'm not that sure i wan na risk every time hahah since flight accidents happen. But i don't wan na die hhahahahah. Margaret: You'll find something. So go ahead for it. Hahahaha you shouldn't think about that. It would be good you would get to travel a lot.

But does the whiskey go well with the cinnamon? Flavored whiskey is the worst ... Alan:  Look what i just found. Yeah, i know - that's awesome. Well, and i found a perfect company for it.

I just wish the brought the old cherry flavor back ... Not the useless no-sugar stuff.

I watched it twice! Alan: I'm catching up with friends. Greg: I'm watching house of cards though must admit the new series is boring. Netflix original bodyguard is supposed to be good from whati've heard.
Sonia: Hey remember last year when you guys went to san sebastian. How was that airbnb place you stayed in. Yeah in a month or so. We r still planning. We checked some hostels and so but they r pretty expensive. Plus we rather have more privacy. That would be sweet. So shes in the appartment too? Oh. Hm i dont know. Toni: Yup. Hi. It wasnt bad. Maybe a bit small for the three of us. But it was next to the playa de la concha. And anyway we just used it to sleep. U guys going? Well i can definitely reccomend the airbnb place. I can get you in contact with the landlady too if u want. Its this old basque lady, widow, pretty lonely but nice. She even made a tortilla for us. Yes she rents a room in the appartment. Well think about it and let me know.

I need to lose some weight and i really want to try it. What are you talking about ? !? Lol. You're so skinny. Should we try one of those together? It's always easier when someone's doing it with you. We can also go for runs together like we used to : -d. So paleo or keto? I think they're practically the same, but you can't have dairy on paleo. I think you can, i'm no sure though. Ok. Are you excited ??
Phil: Same here. Lucky you. I couldn't close any deal. It annoys me. Some customers are negotiating for days, weeks. And then they pull out. That's what they do. Cynthia: Good or bad? Maybe they're just fishing. Want to compare offers. Derek: It's been a long day. Very busy. I closed some deals but i had a lot of stress also.

One needs to maintain a regime to stay healthy for a long term . Lisa: Hello peter. What have you been doing off late? Too much of work, huh? Ohh, trying to get in shape? That ’ s a good thought. I was also thinking of working out a bit. What do you do? Do you go to a gym? Which exercises do you do regularly? Besides exercises, i think i need to eat better to help me keep in shape. There are a lot of things we can do to stay healthy.
Tom: Where is my cup ?! You think? Were you drugged up? Julia: I broke it, i think, sorry. I'll buy you a new one, don't make a drama tom :.
Don: The css tests are today. No, not yet. Hmm ... i don't know. I'll check it later tonight when i get home. Apparently it's supposed to be a database of all the young up-and-coming hockey stars. Scouts use that information for future contracts, etc. Well, obviously not, but it's kind of cool that they'll be in a world database of peewee hockey players. Bring a blanket it can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours. Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid. I'll take the kids next time, i promise! Ok, thanks again, i owe you . Hank: I know! Have you registered in their system? I'm not sure if i have to fill out all the fields. Most of them don't even apply to rodney. It's strange that they're incorporating such professional tests for little leaguers. Ok, but our kids are 10 years old! They're not signing any contracts for now. Yeah, i guess. So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm . 3 hours! I'll probably wait and work on the computer. No shit are you coming. Hey, that's not fair! Yeah, yeah, we'll see. I'll tell you about the tests when i bring oscar and roger back.

They really could have killed you. Jane: Don't ever go to la perle : <. Used to love this place, not any more. Nowi'm good, but they almost killed me. You knowi'm allergic to peanuts. I told themi'm allergic and they ensured me there's not even a trace of peanuts. I started swelling after the first bite - apparently there were crushed nuts in the crust. I just don't get how ignorant you have to be to do something like this.

Yeah, once when i was in high school! There was a run-down building in the neighbourhood and we went to investigate it with my friends. We didn't see any ghosts, haha. But let me tell you that i never thoughti'd freak out this much at hearing a cat meow. There's just something about the atmosphere ... that makes you overreact and find normal but unexpected things really creepy. Yeah, if i could choose again, i'd probably still decide to go - i don't regret it! But i definitely wouldn't try something like that alone ^^ ;.

Denise: It is, but the green one will suit you better. She does, but in my opinion that dress would look better on someone taller. Deb needs a shorter one. Definitely! Kelly: The red one!

Oh right, his birthday is like next wednesday? Sure, that would be nice. But he has not invited me, so i don't want to be rude. That would be cool - i actually haven't seen him in person for a while now. Ok, take care and see you on weekend! Rob: Hey there, what's up? Same. Having a few people over. But the game is boring as fuck lol. That's whyi'm writing. Any plans for the weekend? I've heard that jim is planning to celebrate his birthday. Yeah, normally that would make the next weekend a good time but he is going for a skiing trip with his family. So he said that he might organize something this weekend. Nothing super fancy - most likely a meetup with a few friends at some bar. Would you like to come? Most likely because it is not a real party. When i see himi'll let him know.

Brandon: Me neither, but he seems a nice guy. Dylan: No, not really, i've never had an opportunity. Really, i had no idea he is albanian. Fascinating, where does he come from in albania? What else did he tell you? Insane. Scary but interesting. Abby: Have you talked to miro? Yes, he's so interesting. Told me the story of his father coming from albania to the us in the early 1990s. He is, he speaks only albanian with his parents. From the seacoast. Duress i believe, he told me they are not from tirana. That they left kind of illegally. It was a big mess and extreme poverty everywhere. Then suddenly the border was open and they just left. People were boarding available ships, whatever, just to get out of there. He showed me some pictures, like. Yes, and his father was among the people. Very ! Brenda: You met him yesterday at the party?

Rose: Jesus, why on earth would you watch a japanese horror, home alone at this hour? Cause you're a fuckin moron. Paula : 5 point for gryffindor, my friend. But in your defense, i always thought you were quite unaffected by horror movies. Seems pretty generic. You know that japanese horror are the worst ones, right? I wish i lived in your neighborhood. Oh, man it's late, but why the hell not. I'll bring cookies for the.
Lucy: Pat, as a motheri'm not as good as i always wanted to be ... Are you numb to all emotions? How did you feel when patrick turned 15? Patricia: Why? It's like yesterday she was 5 years old ...

I have this wonderful perdiatrician, doctor tornez, he is great with kids and treats every case individually. I know! But doctor torez i quite different. You can find him at the city medical centre. Exactly. You haven't heard? It's off! Half of the class is sick ... Linda: Hi helen, was jamie at school today? I'm afraid so high fever and a terible cough. How did you get rid of it?

Damian: What happened to your lamp? You didn't do this just to show off did you? Shit happens. You ordered new one yet? Vincent:  I broke it xd. With my bare hand. Hahaha. Xd no. I was playing with my cat with a ribbon. And while raising my hand i just hit the lamp and the glass cover broke. Yeah. Should be ready to pick up on tuesday xd.
Olaf: Hahaha. Everything's fine with me, you're just being silly. Of course i know. It's a cunningly contrived sales pitch. Prices are thought to be reduced but in fact they're the same or even higher ... You're really naive ...  Click on this link and see for yourself. This is one of the sites where people upload photos of the same product and its price 2 weeks before black friday and during the promotion. Carry out your own investigation. Go and check prices of the chosen products when the promotion is still on and check them again when the promotion is over. Simple. Theni'll help you. I know a dude who sells almost new computers at very reasonable prices. Deal! I'll call or text him and ask to contact you. I'm sure he'll help you and you'll appreciate my advice. Nestor: I'm thinking of buying a new laptop. And it seems that now is a perfect time for it as black friday is coming. I haven't said anything funny, what's wrong with you. Why, cuz i want to save some money buying what i need when it's cheaper? Do you actually know what blak friday is about? You're just repeating a stupid theory some people made up and try to convince others that it's based on facts. And how do i know whether it's a reliable source or not? What if the laptop i want has been really cheaper andi'll miss a perfect deal? So ask him to send the offer of what he has in stock to me first. If he can offer me a good deal, i'm going to the mall and starting investigation tomorrow. Deal? We'll see about that.
Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not. Probably so. Not sure, though. Well, it's intended in a completely different way. Imo, twitter is not for interacting like on facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u. Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. I know, buti'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. So, what else? And does this motivate u to train? What? Don't have that much time to write a blog. Nancy, y do u ask these questions ? ; ). Vic: I still prefer facebook. Had twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with facebook. What do u mean? Still, on facebook i can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And i don't have to limit myself to 140 characters. Phil : 280. still, a downside. Otoh, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, twitted would get as cluttered as facebook. I do. That's not all ppl post on instagram! Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts. No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. Heard about it, but never had an account. Me neither. Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ; ). Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion? How about u, vic? So no one uses 4 example instagram? But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on instagram. What do u think about tumblr? It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u! I have my reasons ; ).
Amanda: Have you seen the guy with dreads? I'm not convinced. Peter: Yes, so awkward! Dan: Hahaha, very, but cool!

Nada: Hey girl, what's up? Fuck what happened ?? No sorry, i've given it to my brother - but you're lucky! I've taken these two days off so you can take mine. No worries, it happened ... but i always think about this ... like man, we need some back up laptops! Yeah, but it's like our only tool! So we need to invest in it. Yes ttyl ! Dima: Hello! I'm in a huge trouble, my laptop is broken and i have to deliver a translation tomorrow @ 9. The stupid cat spilled coffee on iti'm freaking out! You still have your old laptop? Is it possible to lend it to me please? Ooh man! Thank you sooo much ! !! If it weren't for trados, i wouldn't be panicking. I know! But i always change my mind and spend the money elsewhere lol. Yup, true! Can i come in an hour to pick it up?
Betty: So where did you go after? Anyone i know. Tell me ! ! ! !! Ohc'mon !! Oh no ! !! Damned bastard. Tell me everything. Was he with someone ? .. Thanks, babes, youre the best, youre my bestie. Kelly: We wander around and met more people from school. Well, yeah. Guess ... Guess who could pass the pub at 2 am ...? Oh yes ! !! Haha but we didnt talk almost, just hi-hi hows it goin. He looked nice, standard. Yes .... betty : : /. I'm sorry sweetie, i told him a few words, he heard from me a bit. Bastard. Not at all love, he is such an ass !
Anne: Hi darling, do you went to come for easter? It's could be nice, i'll invite louise too. Thanks darling . Adele: Love to, i'm off on friday. Great, i'll bring you eggs, chocolat ones of course!
Peggy: No, im spending a lot of time using the library computers. Might be something with the circuit board. They hope to have an answer tomorrow. Thats true. Well see. Ok, good to know. I'll write if i have any questions. You're right . 5 years is a long time to own one. Ok. i might just not bother getting it repaired after all. Melody: Did you get your computer fixed yet? Do they know whats wrong with it? Thats pretty serious. Might be cheaper just to buy a new one. If you need to get a new one, i highly recommend the mac model that i have. Youre probably due for a new one anyway, no? Yes, thats ancient by laptop standards. Sounds like a good idea.
Bitch: P. Jerry: Hi sweetie. I'm coming home. I should be there in 40 minutes. How was your day? I know, she can be a. See you later darling janet : < 3. Janet: Hi sugar ; ). Can't wait ; ). Ok, i'm waiting for you. Oh, it was ok but my boss is a pain in the ass sometimes. Yes she can ! ; ).
George: Self-organised. Cheaper. So, let's start digging and we'll talk about it l8r? Ur right! Mark: So, we've got our where and when. Package tour or self-organised? Actually, not a bad idea. That'll be both cheap and convenient. Slap. Let's do this asap ! Julia: Do we need a 5 * hotel? Maybe let's choose one of the cheaper options from a tour operator? Ok. but maybe let's divide ourselves so that we don't check the same websites? Anna: Package. More convenient. I'm in! Sure. Xoxoxox.
Stanley: I can ’ t believe in her…. Del, she ’ s behaving kind of… stupid. I told her i can ’ t go for this weekend with her because of work. She was angry and wouldn ’ t listen to me. She accused me of having an affair o.o. I know, it ’ s crazy. I starting to give up. No, i ’ ll talk to her when she ’ s back, i ’ ll tell her it can ’ t be like this, see what will she say. Actually, me too. But at least i ’ ll try. Yes i ’ m finishing the analysis for the pervious one, but it should be done tonight, so i can start working on it today. Whaaat. Great. So division of the tasks is on me? We ’ ll do, it ’ ll be ready tomorrow, not sure what time. Btw, it ’ s weird that alison is out of touch. Women…. Bill: What is it? And who? Meaning? And? How did she react? You ’ ve been together for like 4 moths and she ’ s already doing sth like that ? ?? So what, that ’ s it? Sorry to say that, i don ’ t think you ’ ll bring any good news xd. Well, i ’ m sorry. We need to take care of the lidem project right now. The problem is i don ’ t what you should do ; p. The analysis of tasks is not done yet, alison disappeared from all the media and won ’ t answer her phone. Yes because i ’ m already researching when it comes to the funding. Ok, keep me posted. No at all, it ’ s not the first time.
Kimberly: Hi laura. Do u remember if i left the cafe yesterday with my umbrella? Yes, with a flower motive. I got it as a present from my mom a few years back. It's not worth anything, but it's about the sentimental value. Thanks! It's worth a try. Laura: Hey kim. I'm not sure ... I remember you arriving with it. It was a pinkish-blue one, right? I understand, maybe try calling the cafe? Maybe a customer found it or a waiter? Here's the number : 613-785-4329.
Dream: D your hr dept. Gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on monday. Section:  Catherine: Hi jake, last week i applied for an accounting position @ pandora. R u still working there? Time flies. So i take it ur satisfied? Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion? I mean is there a clear career path? That's good to hear. Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer. I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck. And how about the benefits u mentioned? That sounds like a. Thanks jake is there anything i should prepare/review before the interview? Ok, i'll definitely take a look. That's true. I'm a bit nervous though. Thanks. Ttys ! Jake: Hey cathy! Really? That's great! I sure am. It's already been 5 yrs. I am, i rarely think about changing companies. Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits. I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant. That's what i hear from most of my friends. It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays. Jake : 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding. The company partially finances language & accounting courses. There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare. That's great! I'll keep my fingers crossed. Well i think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company. You can find them on the official website, in the `` about us ''. And they may ask u some qs about accounting principles, the basics. But i mean that won't be a problem 4 u. I remember u graduated with honours from uni. There's no need to be. Give me a call after the interview. Good luck!

Matt: I feel like my homestay parents don't treat me that well. They take carlos for subway. And i feel like they prefer talking to carlos. Yea i guess. I don't know. It feels like a negative vibe. Is it because i stay at home too much. And so they have to pay more for electricity. True. Jorge: Why u think so? Do they feed you well tho. Maybe you're just overthinking. I doubt it but hmm. I would give a fuck. You're there one more month and go.

Anastasia: Our new school photos.  Look how happy i am. Ahahaha. That's my mood everywhere i step in. Well. They took the photo in less than a minute actually. Yeah. School photos always suck. They take them so fast and carelessly. Well, i needed a new one for my school id. So i had no choice here. Ah no, i'm not worried, i actually find it kind of funny, it's fine. Darrell: You don't look unhappy to me but it's like you're, uh. What was the word. Sceptical of something darrell : `` what am i doing here ''. Hahaha. Oh wow ... well, i guess there were a lot of people? They would only really take group photos of us in middle and high school. If someone wanted a portrait photo, i guess it was possible. But not obligatory. Luckily no one really has to look at your school id most of the time, haha. Don't worry about it.
Agatha: Wow finally! Are you going with jane? Do: D. Mark: When? Bring us some kimchi! So jealous ... i'd love to come as well. Kim: I'm going to seoul! People on a plane will kill me if i. I'm going in april < 3. Yes, of course - she'll be our tour guide. Really? I asked you like a hundred times.

Alex: What happened? No, i think i was away or oblivious. Tomorrow u need to tell me what happened lol. Sure! I can ’ t contain myself….
Betty: Hi, everything's fine and you? I know, mom, it's justi've been so busy. Ok, i will. Betty : ; *. Mom: Hi, betty, how are you? Me too. You could call grandpa from time to time, you know. He's always asking about you. We're all busy. You don't have to talk long, just check in.

Very funny. I wait as clams open, andi'll add pasta. Whitney: What will be for dinner? What's this vongole? Never seen this word. What does it mean? Oho, ambitious, how are you going to do that? Quite obvious, this is spagghetti alla vontale. Gon na get drunk ). Sounds delicious, i am mouth watering !

We are due on monday. That doesn't leave many options. Alexander: I don't attend that class, but it is fine by me to meet.

That's my girl !
Coming: P. Way: D pics or didn't happen! Joel: Hey, how are you guys doing? How's coco? No. Haha! It took you guys 2 days to win her over. She's usually not that easy. Maybe ... oh, man, i'm jealous ; ) is she behaving ok? You can just hiss at her or clap and she should stop. And if she wakes you in the morning you can just lock her out of the room until feeding time. I'm pretty sure it's. I'm glad. Just let me know if you need anything ok? Trent: Confirmed. Maybe she remembers us visiting you? Tbh she does try to scratch the couch from time to time. Yeah, we do that like you said and it works. So far she's been really sweet. Becky: She's actually sitting on my lap purring right now.  She's a total gem. Absolutely adorable. She hasn't done that yet actually. Ok sure.
Sosie: What's your flat apartment number again? Kyra : 187. Thanks! Will be there in 5 mins. Waiting: P. Kevin: Hurry up! We're all.
Clint: I'm curious. How's the waste management working out over there? Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.? Yeah, i read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here. People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow. Really bizarre. I noticed it's struggling here. On the other hand, it's money. Reducing waste=lower utilization costs. Do they sort through everything further down? It seems to be the same way here. Dry recyclables, food and general, compost. Bins: Compost, recycle and trash. Compost anything organic from yard waste to food scraps. Recycle for paper, bottles, cardboard, plastic, metals. And trash everything else. Why do you ask? Ronnie: It actually works very well. We use three different. Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants. Never ... clint :: What do you mean? I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that. That is true. But at the state government level i don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully i am proven wrong! Money in the sense of? Yes here they do.
Tina: Sorry, i'm still at work .. So many pple today : / : /. Dunno what time i can leave and actually my phone is dying ... Ok, and if it's really late theni'll call u 2morrow. Sure thing.

She told us in confidence, i don't think we should share it with others. Sally: Hi guys have you heard about natalie? Come on! I'm sure you're all curious. Relax jane, what's your problem ?!  Guess who's the father ! !! Dave ! !! Greg: Nowi'm also curious. That's insane !
Steve: Can you byt me some lunch? Anything but chicken. Nick: Sure, what do you want? Gotcha.

Not sure about the date, buti'll be there who else? Still thinking ur getting invites to their weddings? Sure it is ; ) just don't wan na admit it ; ). There we go was it so hard? And u think u can change their minds?
Sal: I ’ m sorry! Get better soon : * millie : < 3. Millie: Heeey i ’ m sick i won ’ t come today.
Daisy: Going home? Please be back before 11 pm. Lisa: Not yet. Ok.
Tina: Almost there, i am already dressed. Chill, i will make it. Sophie: The bus is leaving in 3 minutes, are you coming ? ?? Faster!
Sophie: Hello noah, but of course i am.thank you. That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling. We won't be going your direction any time sooni'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall? It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap. Hey noah, the twins will be on their way from notts tomorrow afternoon and passing windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince? Well we don't see that much of them either they'll be coming home this weekend only because of alexa's ceremony. I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have william at home all that often either, do you? The fate of most military i guess. Hugely unfairi'd say. Like being married to your regiment! Oh dear! What could it mean? I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else. He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if i were you i wouldn't worry at all. They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright? Thank you for the quince ! Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day ... are you still interested? Actually william went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time. Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They ' be alright for a couple of days i guess. The weather's cool. Ok. Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages! Notts is 3 hours ' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much. He gets 5 days at xmas by way of `` family care '' and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own. That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when i ask, he gets brusque. No, not what you think! We know from capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings. We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him. You're probably right. But you knowi'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me. Sure. Thank you sophie for a nice chat!
Sarah: Oh yes !: D. So could you please buy for. If you happen to go the food section, i wouldn't mind a daim's frozen cake and a bag of meatballs ; ). You can use my ikea family card, just give them the number and my last name and tell them you forgot to bring it ; ) 17927192. First one's perfect ; ). Me: White table cloth 120 cm x 140 cm, as simple as it gets, two medium size wardrobe organisers ( the ones with grey flowers ), one wooden spatula and three bottle cleaners. Harry: Going to ikea, need anything? Perfect xd. Ok, got it. Will do my best. Thanks! Stay online, i may need your help.  Is this table cloth ok? Or that one? 
Ellie: Why are you so sad? Something ’ s happened? Cheer up! Tomorrow ’ s another day cindy : < file. Nope, but it ’ s very funny ellie :. Cindy:  I don ’ t want to talk about it…. Have you seen it? It ’ s viral on the internet.

Cool, we just woke up like 20min ago and will eat something too. Of course we had, i hope we will repeat it soon. Hahahah yeah it was. But it was really cool, i'm still in a very dancing mood. Sounds cool ; ). Jannet: Hey, i'm cool, we just got up and now we're doing some.  Sure, we just have to wait for the neighbours to forget about us, cause it was fuckin loud yesterday xd. Perfect, the next time we're going to the disco.
First: D? Jeff : 100 bucks dude, i'll bet your. Wish: D. Body: D i got ta be first one to try it out. Ass: D. Jeff: Dude, wtf, it's like insane. How the hell did he afford it ? ??

Joseph: Hard to control i imagine. Rory: Max, is your sister studying in china? How does she like it? Does she speak chinese? True, i don't think you could stay unemployed speaking chinese. True. Anyway, where is is? Beijing? I've just checked, it has 25 million inhabitants! Insane, it's the population of the whole australia. Eliza: I think this is the best investment imaginable. Sure, the every 5th earthling is chinese. Or so. Max: She is. It's not amazing, but she believes it's a good investment. I think she does already. Hahaha. Really? But there are chinese everywhere and they speak foreign languages. Nope. Shanghai. Yes, she said it's actually bigger than the capital.
Russ: Hi david. Well received thank you. But i haven't read it yet. I'll take a look at the report in a moment and will send you remarks if i have any. Please do. I should be done by midday with the report . David: Morning russ. Have you seen the report i emailed yesterday? Is there anything you'd like me to do right now? Sounds good. I guessi'll just answer some emails.
Ben: Why would i? You know very well thati'm not fond of such visits. They stress me out. Maybe i can but i don't want to. It will end the same way as usual. With me being pissed at everyone. I can visit you and play with them some other day. I don't have to drive to another city to do it. Uncle steve? I don't think so, we don't have anything in common. All he ever does is bothering me with stupid questions about my private life. Yes ... sure ... sometimes i wonder if you're thinking about what you. You should rest then. Instead of asking me to do stuff i don't like. I will. Type: P. Catherine: We're going to visit uncle steve, want to come with us? He's family and we haven't seen him in a long time. Come on, even you can do it from time to time. The boys want to see you. You know that he'll be disappointed? Yes. Maybe that's his way of showing that he cares about you. Depends on the day. Todayi'm tired so i can't guarantee it. Alright, don't worry, i'll stop. But still the part about the boys missing you was true. So come and visit them when you'll have the chance.
Kaya: We have been looking for you in library. Be right there. Clay: I am the class room.
Sean: Hey, i won't be able to take the car to the carwash. They want me to finish report first.  We can leave a bit earlier or get it washed somewhere on the road. Great ! Alice: Shoot, but it's crazily dirty. Will we have tomorrow? It might be good idea, let's do it tomorrow then.
Bert: Yeah, that would be nice of you. I'll try to get there on time. I will. Xx. Julia: Hey, what time are you getting home? Bert : 8-ish. Why? I was wondering if we should wait for you with the dinner? Ok. call me if you're running late.

Mum: Good did they install it for you. Looks really nice. Is it a 12 place setting one? Not but you dont have to put it on every day. Yesi'm glad you are pleased with it xx.
Michelle: Too soon, still researching. Fine. If you stop texting me, i could get on with it! Besides, half of this stuff is black hat. I can't see most of it. It installs bugs on my computer. It's fine. I'm back on it. Harvey: Update? That is an update, michelle. I can't wait all day. Fair point. Why not? Oh, right. Thanks .
Bill: Lovely pie. I really miss you. When are you coming back. Cant wait to see you. Joy: Hey lover boy. I miss you too. On thursday. Me too.
Julia: The one near covent garden? I'm afraid they're closed. Afraid so. I've been there last week and wanted to take my cousin there, but the place's empty. Probably the rent was too high. Me too. I checked online for the owners and contacted them, but they haven't replied yet. I hope they will reopen somewhere else. I know, i know ... we went the lilly's in the end, my cousin and i, but it's not the same. It's all right, it's a different vibe though. I think you should go to the japan centre for the same. Henry: Do you know what happened to cafe kohaku? Yeah. I wanted to reserve a table, but i can't find them anywhere. Their facebook page disappeared. For good ?! Oh no, i loved that place. Unless they do it far away, the location was perfect. It was a real gem in this touristy district. Eh, that's a pity then, i was so looking forward to their brownie. How was the lilly's? Uhm, don't think so. It's always awfully crowded and there are more tourists than normal people like us.
Olivia: I haven't really got anything planned. There are some things i should do which i haven't looked at for a while. I ought to do my accounts. At least get all the incoming and outgoing invoices sorted by months. I know, but doing it all at the last minute is a dreadful headache. I also have a few videos i need to upload to youtube. I don't really do much by way of post-production. I'm not exactly steven spielberg. If i put in any music i always get a copyright strike and someone else is taking the ad revenue. No way! Jake: What are your plans for the day? Like what? Tax filing is a long way off. Anything else? Already ready or you still need to do post-production? I do, but i dont always have time to do much. Yeah. And some of those claims are purely speculative. One time i put on one of my own pieces and it was challenged by sony music. It's true. On the form you fill in to counter the claim i said if sony want to make me one of their signed artists, that's fine. Otherwise to get they paws off of my music .
Emily: Oh linda ... something horrible has happened. I'm so sorry. I have broken one of your green tea cups. Just looked away and brushed it off the table with my skirt. Sorry! I'm feeling so bad about it. So clumsy of me. I was cleaning the cupboards in the dining room. Exactly. I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are. So i thoughti'd be a helpful guest and wash them. I did. And then i made myself a cuppa in the green one. And it happened. Ya. Smashing. As we say in gb. But linda! I'm speechless. Cu. And thank you. Linda: No worries babe! It's nothing. Really. Look. I never really liked the set, so one cup makes no difference. I hardly use it anyway. How come it was on the table btw? You did what? Whatever for? The crockery there is more for decoration. Ya golden! Really! Look, calm down. You are a fantastic guest. You know what? Take out the whole green set. If you like it so much - it is yours. Precious! See you in the evening!
Camilla: Never in ireland! For 2 days? I love your crazy ideas! Tom: Have you ever been to dublin? So let's go there this weekend! Yes, the weather forecast is great! Ok, soi'm buying the tickets camilla : < 3.
Sandra: Hello my dear. I'm getting better every day but there's still something left. I have some effective medicines now. All the drugs that doctors have been prescribing to me so far were useless. Now the difference in my well-being is surprisingly considerable. Oh, i dream of getting out of the house! I used to love laying in the bed for hours, but now i hate it. I'm dreaming of watching some action movie. With all the special effects and dynamic action. Something that would be the opposite of my current situation. Thanks, stella, my darling. You made my day. Bye bye. Stella: Hi sandra. Did you recover finally? I wanted to come and visit you but i didn't want to get infected by the disease that you've been carrying. You know ... i'm a teacher, i could spread the disease. It's very nice to here that, i'm so happy for you! Hope you'll be in a perfect health soon. I want to take you to the cinema. They have a brilliant repertoire now. I understand. Just tell me, what kind of movie would you like to watch? A romantic comedy, horror, fantasy or something else? I'll do some research in my friends ' midst and try to choose the best option. You got it! I'll find something special for you. Soi'm keeping my fingers crossed for your quick recovery. Talk to you soon!
Harley: You should see this divorce filing. Omg ... The guy was a serial cheater! She's taking him to the cleaners. Monthly settlement, half his pension, you name it. There are always two sides ... Never cooked. Never cleaned. He paid for everything yet still managed to buy her mom a house and take extravagant vacays. Voice of experience, sorry! Yes, and some times theres karma, but ... Ruby: Bad? Omg! He deserves it! Maybe she was a piss poor wife? Geez, down boy! Well, people do crazy things. You're right, two sides .

Jack: Hilarious. I love the `` happy menu ''. Man, it's heaven. I need to go. Virginia: Hahaha. Where are you? Samuel : < location >. What did you order? Is it legal in laos? There: P. Samuel: Just a joint for now. But mushroom pizza also looks tempting. I guess the owner bribed the police.

Kas: Probably. Have to check my schedule with work first and let you know. It'll take a couple of days to sort out the mess. I'll let you know tonight if i can do it . Laura: Do you think you can tidy up my dreads for me this weekend?    They're really messy.
Jill: Like 20 or 30. I can't do more than 3-4 per day. Ally: How many did you do so far? How many hours? Jill : 40? Maybe 35 ... Ok, same here.
Exhibition: D what has happened to this world? Mia: No way ... !: D professor evans and art. But you know what? I would actually like to see it !: D. To the exhibition or to the exhibition and to the cinema? You remember that we have plans for tomorrow ...? Ok. I know, i said ok. Yup. I just don't know her very well, it's gon na be stressful for me. Maybe i. Sounds good : *. Right . ; ). Do: D. It: D. James: Amelia said that one of our lecturers in philosophy had an art exhibition ( ! ). It opens tomorrow! I'm talking about this guy who taught us ethics. Amelia recommends. Me too, of course !: P can amelia go with us? Both. Yes, i do. Are you mad at me? Babe, the fact that i suggested that we might go out with amelia doesn't mean that i don't value time that we spend together, just the two of us. Are you sure you're fine with this? But you know me, don't you? Really, there's nothing to worry about. Amelia is quite laid-back and likable . ; ). Afterwards we can go to my place and hang out, cuddle and so on ... : *. So we're good, right?
Rita: No idea, sorry chae-. I ’ ll go tomorrow morning and let you know if the texts are available. I can ’ t buy the copies for you because they never have enough at hand but i ’ ll just ask them to print more for later chae-. Cool. Will do! Xx. Yeong: The only thing i know is that they were not yet there on monday. No worries. Mariana: Hi, just a quick question. Do you know if the readings for the next session of stephen ’ s seminar are in the print shop? Sounds familiar. Arthur: Yer, i ’ ve made the mistake of going on monday as well and i can confirm the texts were not there and the staff was as rude as always. Yeah, just let us know if they ’ re ready, that ’ s a huge favour already.
Ost: I bought a garage place in the garage. I got it cheap. It's my intention to rent it out and do the restitution of my money. There is a big crowd in parking, so the prices for finding garage places are favorable, in this area. Return on investment is much higher than if i give money under term savings in the bank. The interest rates are very small, almost close to zero , `` only they do not ask you to pay them, for holding money in the bank ''. Prices of garage places, in belgrade, will only grow. Yes, there are more and more vehicles in the city center, as the number of vehicles per family is growing. It used to be about one vehicle per family, and now it's approaching an average of two vehicles. And there will not be new parking space . Vesna: Cool. Well doneeeee !. Really !. You make sense for money. O yes. Really !. Yes ..
Always: D. Hania: That's a good question, haha. No idea ... the schedule says the next station is in poraj. Don't even tell me, i have been on the road for 3 hours already. I will be there around 7pm i guess. Great! Nah, i am so exhausted i don't even feel any hunger. Or actually maybe we will order some takeaway? Pizza. Ok, see you soon ! : *. Julia: Where are you? Did you stop in zawiercie already? Gosh, that's really far away. I know how you feel love, i am sick of trains already. I will be waiting ! : *. You must be starving, i am gon na make some food. What would you like? Are you sure ?? Sounds like a plan pizza or burgers? Ok! And i will pick you up from the platform, let me know when you pass żyrardów. See you ).
Kaylee: Enough is enough, i am blocking you now -. I am blocking you, seriously. You really don't care? Gavin: As if i care. Bye. Please go away you are too much irritating kaylee :.
Lara: Yes! Marika: Are you coming today? Great !
Mazie: Me and mah girls are having a drink tonight. Wouldn't you like to know ... That's cold. Oic ... who? You just saw her on a bad day. You did spill a drink on her. You did! Lol. Lee: Oh really? Where? Yes! So i can stay away! True, can't stand some of your friends. Sheryl for one. She's a b-word that rhymes with witch. Don't think so! Well ... I said sorry!
Zachary: Looks delicious! Pls bring me a piece of this later on. I'm pretty busy right now. I decided to clean the flat, can you imagine? Here it goes zachary :. Erin: Hey zach. Look at this babe, i've just baked it.  Oh what are you doing then? Hardly, i need hard evidence.
Joseph: U there, mate? Damn, i'm tired af. Had three job interviews in two days. I think the first two were more than ok, they seemed really satisfied with my résumé, heh, guessi'll have to choose one. Yeah, i guessi'm gon na be a concierge until the day i die. What's so funny about it? Right ! `` well, how do you call it ? '' albert : `` a carhole ! '' xd. Lol! Anyway the third interview was ok but i don't know, the woman there didn't seem to like me. Oh, sod off, mate ! Albert: Yeah. Why? Ouch! So ... any impressions? Were both interviews for jobs at hotels? O la la! A concierge! With his résumé! It reminded me of that simpsons episode, you know ... `` the garage ?! O la dee dah, mr. Frenchman ! ''. No woman likes you, joe!
Graham: Yes give me an hour. Hi sue .. i have 2/3/9/10/16/17/23/ let me know. That is good she came back. Yes we only touched on it last week. Thanks sue. Sue: Hi graham when you have a minute can you throw me some dates over for weekends in the romford area, that lady louise wants another 2 half days and focus on motorways. Brilliant i will send those on. Yes she was nice she wants you to focus on motorways this time. I will let you know when she comes back to me.
Andrew: So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? They basically destroy u! Sensible. Unlike wow. Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly. Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on. That's gr8! And how are they getting along now? Well my favourite genre is rpgs. I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the final fantasy series. Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest rpg series of all times? I thinki'll have to look for new friends ... so embarrassing. Fine ... usually u play a group of friends that have to resolve some kind of crisis. In the last part u play a prince whose kingdom has been destroyed and u try to well get revenge. Believe me, it's not ! John: Yes and no. U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. Can be a lot of fun! That's not a problem. The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u. So what's wow like? Yeah. Y would they allow such a thing? Rly? Lol. Can u name a title, except wow? Well, i haven't. Brett: So what do u do there? Drive a tank all the time? What do u mean? Not cool. Actually, my cousin met his wife there. Yeah. They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. Turned out they lived very close to each other ; ). Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ; ). What's this one about? C'mon! Tell us! Sounds boring.
Zach: Oops! Someone is in a mood ... Is it that bad? What this time? Did you talk to your manager? You're gon na quit? I see. Did you think about it? Girl, it's the best place to work in! A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. Good money and no rat race. You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future. If you want, i can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on. Uw. In touch . Rael: Gosh, i fucking hate my job! I'm serious, i'm done. Those people are fucked up. I can not stand it anymore. Even worse ... I don't even have time to eat my fucking lunch. It's not normal. Yeah, this retard doesn't get that we're humans not robots. I hate him. It's not that easy, i got ta find something. I don't want to leave without first finding a new job. No, why? Zach, are you crazy? I don't have technical studies. Hmm ... maybe you're right. I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so ... why not. That would be great, thanks.
Jill: So how was your date anyway? Tell me everything !! Suit on ?: D. Hahahahaha. So where did he take you? Rollerskating what? Are you serious ? : /. If you say so ... D. I am not ! ! ! ! ! !! Susan: It was perfect, he was so sweet ! ! < 3. So first he picked me up from home, all dressed up and everything. Nooo, not like that, but he had a really nice black shirt, elegant shoes, looked like brad pitt hahaha.  That's the best part! We went to rollerskating disco ! !! No no, listen - it was so awesome, i am tired of all this dull restaurant dates and stuff, it was actually something original. You are just jealous. Yes you are : *.
Joe: Yo. Wan na come over tonite? Gon na watch deadpool 2 with the guys. Ok, i'm counting : 1 , 2 , 3 ... Pete: Yo, sup? Cool! Count on me. Lol.
Domigo: You don't know what it is? O. Shocking! O. That is hit application recently ( ^^ ). You can take some videos for yourself and edit it with music and special effects as you wish ( ^.^ ) ( ^. And share it on youtube or just with your friends. Cause it is new and interesting ! ( ^0. Come on people want something new all the time. I also think tiktok will become less and less popular at some point but it's fun for now. Try it ( ^0. Euodia: What is tiktok? I have no idea but my friends were talking about that. And i felt a bit ashamed of not knowing what they all knoe about euodia : * know. Why do they do that? Omg i don't understand why i feel so old ( ;.
Hugh:  Thanks ! Joan: What a cutie! Congrats! Julia: Is that your son? He's lovely!

Lori: Copley. It's close, i can be there in 10min. Sorry, i misunderstood. There is a traffic jam. Relax, it's friday! I'm there in 5 min. Maria: Where are you? Why not prudential? We don't have time, we were supposed to meet at prudential. You always misunderstand. Harry up, please, i'm so tired. That you would have avoided if you had come to prudential. So i want to enjoy it, instead of waiting for 30min in front of a mall. We will see.
Rose: Why do you say that? Lol yes, that's all he talks about. Marta: I swear that jay is a pathological liar ! ! ! ! !! He keeps talking about how he has all this money and travels all over the world. Well i just found out he lives in a studio apartment in the outskirts of town ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Telly: What are you guys doing on new year's? I was wondering about going to luke's party buti'm kinda hesitant. Oh cool, i wasn't invited,. Oh, ok, cool. Is there a fb event? Great, i'll check it out. Let me know when you make up your mind, might help me too ; ). Ally: Idk ... Yeah me too. As much as i love luke his apartment is not particularly party-friendly. We were also wondering about the spot - they are having a new year's party, but you have to sign up pretty quickly.  Chuck: We're not really sure yet. I think. Ally? There's also a party at bernie's. You know how bernie is, all of his parties are open, it also says so in the description. You got it. Though: P.
Karen: I passed ! ! ! !! Simon: Whooooooooooah ! ! ! !! Patty: Guess we have a new designated. Tim: Congrats ! !! Driver: D.
Bunny: Why? You can make your own peeling. Do you have some real coffee? So make it. Drink it. Relax. And then take the seeds and pour some oil. And scrub your body. Gill: I need a new peeling. This one is not so good. It has only small pieces of seeds. And i need more power. How? I think so. Brilliant thx.
Ryan: Merry christmas everybody! Visiting family in manchester. White a disaster hahhaha. Nick: Merry xmas! Chris: Merry xmas to you! Where are you btw? We stayed home with ann, first time on our own! Andi've liked it so far very much.
Oliver: Dude, how's the campaign going? Good! Have we reached 5000 dollars yet? Crowdfunding is the way ! Bruce: It's more than ok, we've got around 200 backers right now. Yes, we're a little over 6000 ... 6132 bucks.
Liam: Will pick you up at 8. Be ready. Just don't get us late please. Kane: Cool man.
Kate: I just had a fight with chris : /. It's not me who started it. I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose. Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what i think and i know what he thinks so i don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, i don't see the point of talking to him. I'm angry every single time i talk with him. I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it. Right ?! I don't know whyi'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck. What i usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, i sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything. Pfff i bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once. Well, i try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself. I know he's our friend and we go out often, buti'm not sure i can do it any more, i don't want be friends with someone who thinks that mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the us. Yes : /. You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, i'm not interested in staying in touch with him. Mary: Oh no, not again. What was it this time? Eh, i don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say? Oh god. What did you tell him? I'm afraid chris may be too pig-headed for that. I know, to be honest i kind of avoid these subjects wheni'm talking with him. Oh my god he said that? Jesus, i knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much. No wonder.
Celine: We went on skates. No. It's his first time. Thanks to that, we have a lot of fun here. Mia: Where are you? Mark knows how to skate? I would like to be there with you.
Lia: Not sure yet, you? I don't know. My family wants me to come but the tickets are so expensive and i have so much work. How much did you pay? Sarah : 500 quid. It's expensive. I'll see maybe my family can help me out. It would be lovely to spend holidays with them. That's great. Last year we went to negev. It is absolutely amazing. You will love it! Sarah :: D. I wish i could go too ... Mine too. I'll talk to my mum later. We'll see. When are you flying? Great . Sarah: Are you going back home for passover? I'll be going. I know. Same here. I bought my tickets yesterday. What to do ... This year we are going to the desert. The whole family will sleep in a huge tent. Really? That's where we are going this year. Passover is definitely my favourite holiday. On the 28th.
Gene: Did you get the package i sent you. On friday. Jack: No, when did you send it? Shit i should have gotten it by now. Send me the tracking umber i ; ll check whats up gene : 12345678900.
Explanation: D. Miranda: Hi s, could we cancel tomorrow's meeting? I have to work. That's what young doctors do. No they come close to death but survive and it makes them immortal. Stephanie: Again? What happened? You work 20 hours a day! They kill themselves working. As long as you have an.
Clara: Where should we get off? Hahahah. Jenny: Must be really a shithole. Will you wait for us there? Blake: A place called fabro-ficule. It is a bit indeed. I will, on the platform. There's only one platform of course ; ).
Charlotte: What's up bro ?? Hmm .. what kind of pizza and what kind of pasta? Oo, those both sound good. Have the pizza! Then have the pasta silly. Omg raymond, make up your mind. Why not have both? How about this. I come over and we have both! Alright, soi'm going to head over in like 10 minutes. That sound good? Yes sir. See you in 15 . Raymond: Charlotte! Help! What do i want to eat, pizza or pasta? So i have a regular cheese and pepperoni pizza and i was thinking some pesto pennes. That's not helpful. But pasta sounds so good. But the pizza sounds delicious too. I can't! Please help me. Well, that's just unreasonable no? That could work. That way i would eat the same amount but of the two things i want to eat. For sure. Oh, and bring wine!
Zack: Dude have you seen the new jersey shore season? Ahahah no surprise there. But yeah i watched a couple of episodes and it was hilarious. Yep.

I'm gon na start watching, i will let you know what i think. Afterwards: P.
Alive: D. Will: I hate ques. I'm standing in a line longer than the post office itself. In order to just send a damn letter in xxi century. Damn. The best think about my xxi century comment is that the line consists almost entirely of elderly people who don't have bank account and pay their bills via post office paying cash. Where is digitalisation when you need it? Chris: What a time to be. Lines are the part of everday life of any person living in a big city. There is nothing special in it, but i hope you'll think twice next time you decide to send a traditional letter. Haha. Hang on there .
Serena: Waste of time. We went there with ella last weekend. You won't believe. Tobi: Have you been to the new club? Yes, this one. Oh, shit. Ella: Yes, huge disappointment. Because they had such a cool ad campaign. It was empty. Nobody there. Yes, that's the proper word. Maybe, but i won't risk again. Nicholas: Cork? They need some time maybe?
Peter: Haha, no but it will be just dark and cold. Visit the vasa museum, it's really fun. Enjoy ! Molly: Guys, do you think it's a very bad idea to go to sweden for a week in january? We will thanks ; ). Kai: Possibly. But if you stay in stockholm there are always nice things to do. Museums, bars etc. Not so much nature though. Which is truly stunning around stockholm. Exactly. Margaret: We bought some cheap tickets half a year ago and now we're hesitating. Rainy? Yes, but it's january, one would have to go to argentina to enjoy nature.
Frank: Hello, no, i don't. I mean i have some things to do, but nothing special. U serious? Avril ::. Now, u r talking! Surei'll come with u ! D:  D. Avril: Hi! Have you got plans for the weekend? Do you like mushroom picking? Of course not ! ^^. Buti'm going to see horse racing. U comin '?
Mel: Hi, is adam going to multisports, xander really wants to go this week. Would you? The house is a complete pigsty. Work has been full-on this week, pre sales and all that! Yes, you had a nasty little bunch on your section. Most have left now, thank god! I'll bring him round at half 10, is that ok? I do appreciate this! Mair: Adam is moaning about going, but if xand is going, he might be a bit keener. Do you want me to take them this week? Yeah, i remember that. Glad to be out of it and the bitching and bullying, of course! What are mates for! See you both tomorrow !

Pam: Hey i lost my phone so if you need something message me here. I went shopping and when i was paying i must have left my phone on the counter. I talked to every single store i visited and nothing. Yeah, i've only had it for half a year. How? Cool !! I have to check it out. I'll do that !! Thanks !! Dot: Oh now how ?? Did you come back to check if they found it? It was an iphone right? But there's an option where you can display something on the screen. You have to log into your apple account and there is an instruction. You could promise a reward and post someone's phone number. I hope you find it : *.
Ross: Do they have any idea who did it? You think it was a student? They could do it just for fun. There are cameras. True that. Rodney: Have you heard a guy got beaten and mugged on campus? They're gon na give an official statement about. There's also gon na be an article in the paper. As far as i know the assailant had a mask on. He's in the hospital, but it seems like he'll be fine. Who knows what those jocks are capable of. They don't give a fuck. Truman: Oh, man is he ok? And what about the beaten guy? On the other hand its easy to get on campus without being detected. If your masked it don't matter. You know how those security guards are. Hope they catch the guy soon.
Nathan: Hey honey, what are our plans for tomorrow then? Totally true, i started packing my stuff in the bedroom, i also told the girls to start packing too. No, i explained to her that he'll be fine without her these few days, i hope it. I remember, lucy was really excited about that. Are we taking the bicycles? Now you're talking! We could have a ride to this beautiful cliff where we were last year! So tomorrowi'm seeing the dentist after work, you go to pick up the girls from school…. Thanks honey, so nice of you to remind me of this! After the quick bite you girls have, we are off! Yes, it's feasiblei'll do it on my way from work. I should be home around 6, if nothing happens. Worked: D. Deborah: Soi've been thinking that we should pack everything today, we won't have time tomorrow. If sofie wants to take the unicorn we won't have much space in the car xd. We need to take boots and those warm jackets for the girls, my parents promised them to take them on a trip to the forest. Yeah, don't you think we could use some alone time while the rest of the family is hiking? Xd. Why not, it's a wonderful idea ! : *. Yeah, then we meet at home, have a quick bite ( you probably won't, haha ! ). Damn, i forgot to buy this syrup for travel sickness. Will you have time today to do it? Wonderful! So see you in the evening then? Dinner will be waiting for you in the oven, bye : *.
Alexander: Hmm ... To be or not to be, that is the question! But remembering the last lecture with linda, my answer is like moving towards no. I think it's not that the subjects themselves are boring, it must be his voice. I mean it's so monotonous and hypnotic. Kind of ... lulling you to sleep. Haha david. Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a. Not a bit! And learning from igor's last experience i think we should go somewhere else instead. I don't want to end up snoring and getting. All right ! Igor: Amen to that, alex! Last time i came so self-motivated and full of energy that i thought i could even dominate the lecture. I sat in the second row, concentrated, even took some notes and asked two questions. After few minutes lewis poked me and told to stop snoring ... Yeah, that guy is like david copperfield among lecturers. So ... judging from the overall tone of our discussion i feel that the decision's been already made. Am i right, gentlemen? So where are we going instead? Agreed. Casper: Is any of you nobel fellows going for tomorrow's classes with mr linda? Ahahahaha. True, i saw that! That's a fancy nickname, i like it. But if i wanted to see a magician, i'd rather go to the circus. Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense. Great, so we've reached an unanimous decision. Let's meet near the university and we'll work something out. Embarrassed: D. Little: D. Copperfield: D.
Judie: Oh there's warsaw ink. Nope but my gf has.  It was a 1000. Javier: Hey do you know any tattoo parlors over here with english speaking employees? The name sounds neat ... have you had a tattoo done there? Got a pic? Wow that looks amazing. How much did she pay? Fuck. Let me just get a tatttoo back in colombia then, thx.
Michael: Thanks, mate. You ’ re damn right, sam. Are you coming on the 15th of august? Jessica: Thanks sam. I ’ m soooo happy to see you again! Sam: You own a really nice hotel, guys. How is our hotel room set for next month? Hope that the manager will arrange the very best for us. Yep! We ’ ll be at the hotel around 2 p.m. Me, too.
Mohammad: Sure, but i really trust you. So let's go there, it's still cheaper than italy for example. Gavin: Me too. Yes ! !! I love it! Cynthia: Great, thank you for that. It seems just perfect. Website:  Marsha: Guys, we've planned the trip with john last night as we promised. But of course you have to agree on that. So as we decided last time, we will spend a week just on the beach. We all wanted some calm, nice place, right? John found this little hotel in nosy be.  And their. It's quite basic the website, but it may actually be a good sign. I know. It's more expensive than hotels on the mainland. But it seems to be the most beautiful place in madagascar. Exactly !
Cyprien: What do you mean? Well i was born in jarrow, live in london now, so you could say i came from either of those places. I was educated in loughborouogh, so in a sense i came from there. In another sense i come from my mother's vagina, but i dare say everyone can say that. In another sense i come from the atoms in the air that i breath or the food i eat, which comes to me from many places, so all i can say is `` i come from planet earth ''. Wait, what you got against earthlings ? Adelina: Hi handsome. Where you you come from? What do you mean , `` what do you mean ''? It's a simple question, where do you come from? Ok. Are you all right? Ok, bye. If you're gon na be a dick ...
Joanna: I need to get the coffie stains out of my dress. Do you know any effective methods? It's ecru and the fabric is very soft. You might be right, just hope it won't cost me an arm and a leg ... Alright then, i'll give it a try, thanks ethel ! Ethel: What color is this dress? Well, in such a case i wouldn't recommend fixing it by yourself because you can ruin the dress ... Better leave it at the dry-cleaner's. There's a cheap one at jagiellonska 3, they cleaned up all the stains from my favourite dress.
Anna: Hi, would you like to have a pizza with us tonight? Ok, no problem, have a nice evening.  Charlie: No thanks, i don't want to appear rude, but you knowi'm still upset about all the things that happened. Yeah, you too ... Yeah, cheers.
Ovi: Yeah idk. I don't feel like going anywhere. But still got ta go work. Oh really. Kris: Why is it so cold outside? I am literrarily dying. Literarily *. Nadine: Wll at my clinic. We're getting lots of sick patients. Ya, these days have been rough. Jason: I've been running around the city all day in this cold. I'd probably get sick.

Pat: Chicago what? Dunno. Its soccer right? Nah. Baseball and hockey is wot i luv. Bears is football. White sox is baseball. Blackhawks. But not doing well right now. True enough.

Nate: They've just sent me an excel file with all the registrations. Overbooked! A little bit. I guess that's better than having half of the room empty. Let me check ... Shit this is the worst, the registrations are transformed into text in excel. Shitty one. I have to create a new file and feed the data into the tables myself. Julie: How are we doing ?? No ... How many people for the first day dinner? Ok. Omg what registration system is that. What should be do? The worst .
Farrah: No problem! It was my pleasure! Oh, gee, that's so nice! I am, but not everyone appreciates it. If you leave them sitting around, they just become dust magnets! Especially with little kids, they get so amazed! It was a fun day. Of course! Any time! Sure thing. Fair enough. No problem, i understand. Of course! Any time, and now i have a better idea of other ones to bring next time. Some of the questions really made me wish i had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical. Thanks! Enrique: Thanks for sharing your collection with the class. They loved it! Not everyday you get to see some of those up close and personal like that. We were wowed! You have a great collection, you should be proud! Fossils are a unique thing to collect, that's for sure. So it's good to share them. It was for us as well! Will you come back again? I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. Can i give your name and number to that teacher? I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester. Thanks again! It was really interesting! That would be great. Oh, i understand. I'm sure you'll do fine next time with whatever you bring. Our pleasure !

No, actually, i'd like us to go to this new bistro i discovered. It's super hipster, super cool. People bring their dogs and everything. It's clean cool and their food is delicious.
Amanda: I'm on the highway still. If you want you can call the guy from airbnb and already take the keys. You can even go there and wait for us inside. But i need at least another hour. And will even more from arezzo. Not at all hahaha. Perfect, let us know it everything is ok. I looked quite long for a room with a view. I liked it a lot ! Will: I'm on the train in arezzo. Really? I though i was quite close. Wow! Impressive, and wasn't even that expensive. I haven't seen the movie. Lorenzo: Where are you? I've just arrived here. Hmm, i would prefer to wait for you guys. Ok, soi'll take the keys and go to the room. Ok. I'm here, the room is very nice and we have an amazing view on the duomo!  Hahahah we are now proper 19th century british tourists in tuscany.

We thought you might be interested in joining us because the film is actually on the making of the play you saw. Just come to ours for an early dinner/drinks and then we ’ ll grab an uber. Cool katy :. Katy: Hey carlton. It ’ s a multi-layered cultural sandwich we ’ ve got for you carlos. Ana wants to avoid you getting lost on your way and/or being late. So perhaps you could drop by at like 7. on saturday !! Carlton:  What are you up to? Any plans for the weekend? Yes, she ’ s pretty famous actually and she ’ s done some work on my subject. I ’ ve seen her play about the malvinas last year - it was v good. Sounds delicious. Where and when are we meeting? Ha ha ha sounds good to me. Erm, sorry - saturday is fully booked. Just joking i ’ ll see you then.
John: Look, bristol stool scale - perfect to read in the morning. Henry : : -/. I was expecting a pic of your poop. Constipations are the worst! My man !: D. I think it's a good metaphor. Yes, like very psychoanalytic. And showing you're not pretentious. Henry: No, sorry. No no, i had a nice poop this morning! I never really am constipated. Maybe i should write it on my tinder profile ? `` never really constipated ''. About emotions etc? Hehe. Maybe still not the best strategy overall though .
Mary: In a week! Unbelievable. You're such an alarmist! I'm telling her this all the time, but it's pointless. I doubt. Maybe for 2 hours somewhere close to tokyo. James: Hi girls! When are you flying to japan? But scared of what ?? Hahaha, you're really a damn alarmist. This is so exaggerated, are you serious? Listen, nothing will happen. First of all the earthquakes happen rarely, even in japan and only in certain places. It's not like the whole country is shaking all the time. And, most of all, japanese have amazing architecture because of their experiences with earthquakes. Their cities are super safe. Are you going to be at the coast even? So i don't think the next tsunami in japan will happen exactly at that place and time, relax and enjoy. Japan is really an amazing country. Patricia: I can't believe either. I am also increasingly scared. The long flight, earth-quakes. God, and tsunamis! James, i almost never travel, i'm afraid really. What about tsunamis? Mary, are we? Thanks james.
Mika: Dear linda, would you like a few plants for your garden? All perennials.it would be a shame to throw them onto the compost heap. A nice offer, thank you, but i won't manage to do any gardening before leaving. What a pity ! Linda: Hello.
Drade: Mum he got out of the group chatting room. I just said what he had said was wrong! Why should i? I didn't say anything wrong ! ! ! !! He failed in his business, didn't he? He acted like an asshole first. Marenda: I am sure he is angry! Why did you act that aggressively? You know your brother's temper. Apologize and send the invitation to him. But did you have to talk about it? Language! No need to talk about it more.
Kate: Hey, do you know if our medical insurance covers hospital costs? I broke my arm and they're sending me to the hospital : /. Thnx. Greg: Hm, it depends. Call linda or ask someone at the reception, they should be able to tell you what kind of package you have. Mel: What happened dear?
Frank: Sure why not. Let me know later when the plan clarifies. Charlie: My sister has just passed her last exam on her uni. Got something to celebrate. Wan na go out with us tonight? Kk .
Bella: Will you be home tonight? I'd love to. But first have to see how dad's doing. No pro. Is 7:30 ok then? In actual fact i want to have a talk with you. I sort of need your advice. Not yet. I mean it's nothing dramatic. Just need to talk to you. Myself i would say. Oh dear ... i'd appreciate a snack but let me bring the wine. No pro . Clara: Wan na pop in? I won't be back before 7 though. Am at the gym. Why don't we go and have a drink? It's friday evening after all. Eh? Something happened ?! What about? I've guessed so much! Very well. Come anytime after 7:30 andi'll fix us a snack. Beer? Wine? Ok cu. But you'll have to park somewhere along the road as my drive's taken by my camper at the moment.

Steph:  And whatd'you think? Ikea. Wasn't sure about the colour scheme but the lamps decided. Still need proper hangers, preferably from copper. Not made of copper, but copper coloured. Dunno ! Sharon: Hey! It is superb! I love the lamps in particular. Copper is very much in. Not too expensive? But of course, stupid me. Where can you get them?
Peter: Need to talk to u ... Ok . Anna: Can't talk now, i'm still at work : /. Will call u in 20 min, ok?
Jesse: Can i borrow your razor? I broke it. Fell right out of my hands. Stig: What happened to yours?

Boston: I guess? What's up? Oh ... what's the name? Can you take a photo? All right, i looked it up.  No problem when in doubt, you can do a reverse search on google images. Not always accurate but can help a lot in many cases ! Jessica: Hey, you're good with plants, aren't you? I got this plant for my birthday and it's kind of ... dying already. That's the thing, nobody knows the name so i can't evne look up how to care for it.  Oh wow, thanks!
What: O seriously? Amber: Hi erin, guess what, john and annie are coming back to london! John lost his job in germany! Yeah, his whole team got liquidated. Yeah, and he was the only one who received an offer from the company to be relocated back to london. But he didn't accept it. B/c they only offered him the job after a month & during that time he started searching for a new one. He got a better offer from a different it company in london. Exactly, but you know what this means for me? Yup, we had an agreement that i would be renting their place until they returned from germany. But you know, they planned to be there for at least 5 yrs. She's pretty pissed off. I mean the plan was to save up for a house and only then come back to london. She had already enrolled in german classes & they were starting to feel at home there. Thanks erin! Annie already told me not to worry, that i can stay with them until i don't find something new. Buti've already started searching. Thanks, ttyl. Erin: Hi amber, wow that's news. What caused the change of plans?  No way !? Ok, well at least he's not unemployed. Why not ?! Well good for him! Since they weren't able to appreciate his work and they didn't offer him something right away. You're going to have to search for a new flat ... I can imagine that annie isn't happy with this turn of events. That's too bad. Sometimes life turns out to be unpredictable. If you need somewhere to stay for a while, you can always stay at my place. Good luck and let me know if you need any help! Bye !

Maybe ... i'm kinda mad at her right now >. Lois: Yeah, i couldn't get onto my aacount for some bizar reason. Buti'm thinking of deleting both - i mean, i created it when i was 10! Mean. Yeah yeah.

Ricky: Did u guys see what's going on outside? This reminds me of a time when i was hiking in the mountains. U don't strike us as the type. So what happened? Tom: Haven't seen such weather in yrs! Yeah. What's so weird about it? Well, i did. It was a couple yrs back, i admit. I was still a student and we went as a group of friends to the mountains. I think 5 or 6. myself included. We rented a cabin in the wild. We wanted to have a weekend away . Shelly: A real blizzard! U went hiking? How many of u were there?

Jake: Hahaha. Sure. When i get home, we'll talk about what should we buy for everybody. Yup. Me too . Rose: Payday's. Can i start thinking about christmas gifts now? I can't wait. I love making gifts for people! Tomorrow: D.
Martha: How do you feel about minimalism? If expensive lives longer, ofc. I'm asking because i just saw this documentary about minimalism gurus. And i felt mixed about it. I feel there are so many conflicting priorities when it comes to shopping. If you want to buy durable stuff you usually pick brands you know, big brands. And then it might not be fair trade product. Huh. Jake: I used to think it's total bullshit. Like, it's still about spending. But it's about shifting the paradigm from buying cheap to buying expensive stuff. Right. I think it's a good idea to buy things that will serve you longer. But it's so difficult to be mindful about everything you buy. Take leather for example. If it's ecological it's cruelty free but it has higher carbon footprint than leather. So your values clash all the time when you shop martha :.
Albert: I've just passed the driving exam holy fuck! Albert : 4th attempt! Juliet: Congrats mate! Now nothing can stop you.
Jaya: Hello ravi, i haven't seen your mother in the club for almost 4 months. Is she fine? Ravi : - she is not keeping well these days. So sorry to hear that, what happened? Any specific reason for the pain? Oh, she had always maintained a healthy lifestyle, i wonder how this happened. Did you try naturopathy? Your mother is a strong lady. She never gives up so easily. Please ask her to take care and start feeling better soon. Ravi: She has been suffering from knee pain for almost 5 years now and the doctor has asked her to restrict movement. Its probably arthritis. The doctor said that it can be controlled, but not cured completely. She did have mild ache in her knees for the past few years but had been ignoring it. We tried almost everything. She is still the same, however abiding by the doctor ’ s advice she prefers to stay at home most of the time. Thanks. I'll pass your wishes to her .
Justin: Steviee, that's what lots of sugar babies say and want the public to believe, doesn't mean its true. I don't believe what you said for a second. Lynn: Sorry it's not worth it to have sex with some old wrinkled guy to pay your bills who rubs his old saggy balls all over u ewww fuck that. Can't even imagine. Yes true . Diana: I totally agree. And she ’ s not even that pretty my lord. But to each it ’ s own if materialistic as what she craves and i guess she is fulfilling her fantasies. But i don ’ t want no old balls on my four head lol no thanks. Kellene: Lynn what ’ s going to happen when you ’ re in your 60 ’ s and every man close to your age has saggy balls? Will you only date younger men then? Perhaps, this girls sugar daddy ’ s do exactly that. Steviee: Lots of sugar babies don't actually sleep with them. Sometimes it's purely friendship and companionship. Hahahaha. Lmao: P. Wilbur: Omg ! !! Lynn ... you've got me laughing so hard! I'm crying! Haha !! I seriously just spit my soda out ! !! Lmao. You know what they say, from old egs, comes salmonela. Not all of them expect intimacy some of them just want your company lol.

Gloria:  I'm too poor for my lifestyle. It's so frustrating! Yeah but bear in mind that my therapy is expensive. I cook. I made sushi and tiger prawn korma. Maybe i should plan my meals better. Thanks for the tip.
Haley: I found this old photo on my computer - look how cute bella was a kitten < 3. She was the cutest little baby. About 2 weeks i think. Yup, in cat years she's actually middle-aged. No doubt ; ). Tess: Omg omg omg < 3. I can't believe she's so big now. Jenny: Awwwwwwwww. How old is she in that picture? Haha, yeah, she is. But still totes adorable.
Peter: Yup, was apparently the worst since the end of the 19th century. I know, it's hard to say what may happen because trump is rather unpredictable. But people in my bank seem calm, at least 2019 should be calm. I agree, i'd expect a global economic meltdown in the early 2020s. Jeff: Have you heard about this christmas at wall street? I've listened to some radio podcasts about the american economy. And it's pretty scary, i mean the economic war on china that trump is waging and all his unpredictability. Buti'm not an economist. And the eu? How do you think? Miranda: But it's bounced back since, no panic. Yup, calm, but the global economy will get weaker. And the growth will be weaker but not tragic, i suppose. We just don't know what will happen to the uk and with brexit. There are many different scenarios possible. But it seems that 2020 may be much worse.
Alexa: I want to confess something. I asked ethan to insult you. I was too jealous to see you with ethan that day, dats why. We would talk about it tomorrow. Hunter: What is it? But why did you do that? But you could just ask me not to do something if you dont want me to?

Tim: I am, but i am not called anna. It's tim. It's a girl's name here. Doesn't sound very brother-like. So what is your language? Is that spoken in india? Is it one of those written right to left? Wow. So it must be pretty big, then, teluguland? So what is the word for `` younger brother '' if `` anna '' means `` elder brother ? ''. How old are you, i would have sid about the same as me in your photo. Wow sorry to say it but you do look old for 35:. Samuel: Are you there, anna? Sorry, brother tim. Anna is just the word for elder brother in my language. My apologies. It is telugu, brother. Yes, in south east india. Bangalore and chennai and other places. Nearly 90 million speakers, brother. No, it is written left to right. It is based on brahmin script, our writing. If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the phoenicians, like english writing the same. It is 23 provinces, anna. But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month. Thammu or thammadu. You can call me thammu. I am younger than you. How old are you, anna? Tim : 55. Well there you are you see. I am 35 only. So you are my anna and i am your thammadu. That is because it is not an easy life when you are not earning much money, anna. We work very hard and have very little. But still we are thankful for what we do have .
Jen: Pear but only if they've got it. Otherwise don't worry about it. I don't like any other flavour. If they don't have pear just don't get anything at all then. Pete: What flavour yogurt did you want again? My brain is like a sieve today. I'll have a look around. If they don't have pear can i get a different flavour? Ok .

Jog: D. Killjoy: D. Dying: P. Matt: And the key word is `` tried ''? Not to mention that you have the weirdest habit to stat the conversation 5 minutes before my work. Good ( or bad ) thing is that i need to stay a bit longer today ; ). It's not a problem for me, you're the one getting a short conversation ; ). I would. I'm taking pills that slows my heart rate and that doesn't bode well with any kind of physical. My heart doesn't know what to do. Power of mind ; ). And it's your first try in a while. Your body doesn't know what to. Back in the days when i was still playing football my first performance after a long break was always spectacular. I always felt like a physical god. But the next ones were just horrible and i felt like i was. That's whati'm here for. A reality. Anyway, done with my work for today, finally can head home! Cya later. Expect: P. Sorry: P. Check: P. Then: P. Collapse: P. Ends: P. Chris: I tried jogging today!  I have no other friends ; ). Anyway, i was certain thati'd just collapse after 50m or so but i did quite well. Medication is a different thing. I just don't understand how i can run better when i eat 1/3 of what i should ... I need to analyse my performance. Maybe i can get even better than that! Oh, you. You're basically saying thati'll crash during my next. Cya ! Effort: P.
Eric: Yo yo. Have you watched punisher season 2? I think the first one was better but the second one did some things better. Like showing frank as the actual punisher and not just a guy seeking vengeance for his family. Anyway i think they should have given jigsaw more scars. Anyway it's a shame they discontinued daredevil. Netflix's walk of shame. Dan: Yo man. Yeah, it was cool. Like what? Yep, season 1 was kinda weird. Yeah. I know ... shame shame shame. They're as blind as matt murdock but without the radar xd.

Jacob: Hey, guess what, top management is coming from france next week. Yeah, we got an invitation via outlook to the meeting. And mandatory formal dress code required. The usual, cost savings, lean office, lack of salary reviews ... You know how it is, their visits never result in anything positive. Alex: Hey, again? They just announced it? Omg, i wonder what they're goin to announce this time. That's true, changes for the worse .

Stewart: Can you believe he even said that about the forests? Raking? Really? He just has no clue. I can't wait to vote for anyone else but him. Yeah, but we couldn't go another 4 years with a democrat. The country would go broke! You've got a point! I know. How is that even possible? Only on the fringe. We have to make the best of it now. Nothing we can do. Exactly. But that's not for a while. From your mouth to the dem national committee's ears! We should volunteer. Get out the voters or something. Let me see what's out there andi'll let you know. Shari: Yes. I can believe that this is an ignorant man. He proves it daily. This just one more example! I mean, there are so many people dead and all he can think to do is criticize the forestry department? With a totally inappropriate suggestion? Puhleeze. I know what you mean. Half my friends voted for him just to see what would happen! Well, guess what? Maybe, but at least we wouldn't be hated around the world and led by an ignorant piece of shit! I'm not sure he will finish out his term, with all the legal problems, but he seems to be able to hold off the big stuff. Somehow. I'm not sure. I mean, he's breaking amendments to the constitution here! Maybe. Except vote him out! Closer every day. If only there was a good candidate. Lol! Good idea. Great !
Lydia:  Would you believe it? I added him on facebook. He accepted my invitation. I viewed his profile aaaand ... `` engaged ''! I don't know ... maybe it's a sort of open relationship? Yes, buti'm trying to ignore him. Yeah ... i'm embarrassed now. But how ... it was so dirty. That's weird, i know. Do you think i should talk to him? But we work in the same company. I don't want it to be awkward. Yeah, you're right. This scumbug will regret that he met me . Camila: Say whaaaaat? But how? What a bastard ... but i don't get it ... he knew you would see it. Does he still write to you? Gosh ... if this girl knew ... You shoulnd't, you didn't know. It's not your fault. And nothing happened. You two just texted. C'mon, how would you know. I can't believe he is still texting you, now ... when you know everything ... I wouldn't pull any punches. You're kidding? You should talk to him. It's not fair what he's doing and it can not be like that anymore! Think about this girl!

Boris: Due to the number of pto requests this week, we had to decide who will be allowed to take off based on seniority. Unfortunately, you are too low on the totem pole and we will have to deny your request. I can give you first choice of dates the week after, but that's the best i can do. That is a rare, but yes, i will come to you first. Again, i'm very sorry. Certainly. That should be no problem. Very true. No problems from my side. Yes, please come see my assistant at your earliest convenience. Thank you for being so flexible. That's it exactly. My pleasure. Have a nice holiday and enjoy your time off.

I can do that! Renee: What else are you wearing? Definitely rethink the outfit. Either way you'll look like a waiter! Lol! Stick with the black pants and see if you have another colored shirt?

Tania: Why the hell not, college work is really doing my head in with the deadlines! Yeah, saw her in the canteen a couple of days ago, she's thinking of breaking up before uni.

If anyone is suited to becoming a dr love, it's you, i am positive of it! Hell, yes! See you !
Jerry: Wow. That was kind of depressing ... I get it. The less you know, the happier you are. However i try to look for positives. Hahaha. Dark humour. I luv it. I feel. You: D. Anna: The more i study the more i think it makes no sense. We learn about historical moments in our civilization. We learn names and dates, we learn about great moments of human race and we learn about our mistakes. We learn all of it and get idealistic. We develop utopian concepts of how world should look like. And all of it makes us miserable when we face reality. We face corruption, politics, war, conflicts hatred, egoism. Ignorance is a bliss you know ... So do people doing hiv tests. The only thing that makes me feel better is actually dark humour.

We have to go anyway.  Edward: I dont wan na go on that business trip tomorrow. You think its gon na be just a few meetings with clients. Expos are not as stressful as meetings tho.

I'm working for my uncle kev at the building site, my cousin was taken on with an apprenticeship in bricklaying last year, maybe do that myself. Why don't you talk to them about it?

Deana: I thought they belonged your cathreen! Mine either. Look, maybe you feel like keeping them? I seem to have so many sunglasses ... deana : 8‑d. In this empty place above the radio.

And you can look at them like museum exhibits. I think they're divided somehow, but have no clue how! Well, partly. Most of them were exhibited in their clothes. Basically only skulls and hands. Ollie: That's so cool! Do you get to see the bones or are they covered up? Me too !
Maria: Hi spence, life treating you well? Getting your name out there! Saw some of your new stuff on instagram, liked it! Same old, same old. Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing. How do you get new clients, spence? I really need to pick your brains sometimes! Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, i imagine. Hmm, i'll have to budget carefully when i do it. Well, your passion is obvious! Your stuff is amazing! You've inspired me, spence. See you soon, hopefully! Spencer: Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that! Yeah, thanks love! How's the call centre? Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations. Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops i sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. I probably get around £1000 of work a month now, before commission and tax. Yes, it's tight, but i am very frugal. Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills. Yes, but it's well worth it. I love the work so much! Well, so was yours in uni. Don't let your talent go to waste! See ya !
It: D. Joe: Sure, what's up? As you knowi'm always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. You will just need to stop me when i get too wound. Yeah, sure - just a few general tips. Start games before you start drinking and don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no game of thrones. Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like arkham horror, robinson crusoe, pandemic. Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some'vanilla ' games - like codenames or catan. Any idea what they might be into? The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life. Yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns. Up: D. Tim: Hey, you have a few minutes? I'm thinking about inviting a few people from work over and i kinda thought that maybe some boardgames would be a cool idea. And i wanted to consult the expert on the matter. Haha ok, so i know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? And what games to bring? Got. Not really - there are some guys who i know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls ... Yeah, i know, all too well. Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start. Will do that.
Anne: I completely forgot about it! You guys have time tomorrow? Sure. After 3pm? Works out? Holy: When is it due? Richard : 15 dec. Omg. I am out of town! I will be back on monday.

Ya and we will start planning out stuff. Ok sure.
Russ: Hi gurdun, are you feeling better? Do you think you'll be back at the uni this week? Oh, that's fine. I guess that's pretty normal at this stage. I know what you mean. I had flu like that three months ago. True enough. I had the same. Same old, same old, you know. Not much happening in the middle of term. Oh yeah, we won the last match. It was a good game. Ok, talk to you later . Gurdun: Hi ross, a little bit better, yes, thank you. Not tomorrow for sure, but i hope wednesday maybe. Yeah. I'm feeling a bit weak still. I believe so. And the muscle pain. Luckily the headache's gone. It was absolutely awful. Anyway, how are things with you? And the team? Great. Listen russ, i need to run. Catch up later.

Europe: D. Simon:  It's funny and scary at the same time. Btw it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of eu significantly. I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation. I mean being economically delayed for few decades. Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made. The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. I admire poles. I admire them for they will to fight. They never give up. I tell you, there will be time, when only poland will have power to fight with internal problems of europe. Let's hope not. I agree. Conclude: Christmas in poland will be the best christmas in. Charlie: This photo is great. It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize eu policy. Berlin has put concrete blocks around christmas fair, belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city. Poland though ... One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism. The question is - for how long ... Yup. And as long as there are people in poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation. Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map. Maybe. But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart. Yup. To.
Tilly: Just leaving school now? Yes had to go for detention. They are useless. They are supposed to tell your parents if you get a detention. About 40 minutes. Ok - see you soon . Sam: Where are you?

Ok .. i'm going back to mine - phone me when you are home.
Mell: Hi there! How are you doing? Not much happening either. An odd phone call with the kids. Or tad's sister ( not much otherwise. I don't know. Sometimes i even forget that i should be missing them. In a way i do like this peace and quiet now. I guess you're right. But maybe i should feel guilty or something? Thanks gloria. Yes! Splendid! I'm all for it. At my place? I'd love it. We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion. We'll have a look at them. Now the bbq. At the weekend i suppose? Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall i do the food and you the drinks? Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you. I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to scotland and i don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too. Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her. Looking forward to our bbq on saturday! Gloria: Hi mell! We are fine, just the daily grind ; ) and yourselves? Yeah ... life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. We had more to get used to it. But it must hard for you. Especially you i mean. Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now. Don't be silly! You are a fantastic mom. Anywayi'm happy to hear from you again. We should really have a nice do again. The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a bbq. What do you think? Can't be better. I love your garden. I'd love to. But you know how little i know about garden design, or however you call it. Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on saturday, mark has penciled something in but i can't read it. So what about this saturday? Andi'll get us some dessert as well. Ta! You were thinking about tad's sister? Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her. Yes, we are. Ohi'm so happy you've phoned! So long !

I should be home by 6, so let me know when you can . Martin: Well, i can try. Depends what it is? Hmm, i can't today, but how about tomorrow? Shouldn't take long anyway. Don't mention it, we've known each other for so long it's almost like we're siblings, haha.
Everett: Ralph asked me if i could give him your phone number, is that cool? My friend, i introduced him to you at the pub last week, tall, brown hair, weird laugh ... No. Amy: Who's ralph? Oh i remember him now, is he a psycho? Ok, he can have my number.
Ross: About 2 hours, why? I thinki'll be worn out after all hat work, baby. Ok. Then just to be safe let's say it will take me 3 hours. Damn it, diane, don't start again.

Do you want to watch a movie? How about ugly truth? At your service. Ok, bye !
Michael: It's good for us, vanessa and i are still on our way and peter's stuck in a traffic. Vanessa: God knows, michael's driving if you can call this driving ... It'll be a hell of a birthday party ; ). You need to stall harry then because we're all probably behind him. Peter: There's been an accident, i'm too far away to see what exactly happened but it doesn't look good. They're saying that there was a serious accident, i really don't know how long it will take. It'll be easier if you all come and join us here. Fyi, we haven't moved an inch in a while now. May: Just received a text from harry he'll be late. Probably the same traffic harry's stuck in ; /. How long may it take? Half of the guests is already here. Harry just called, he's in the same traffic as you. Hahaha, very funny. We'll wait for you, but better be here before harry.

The only problem i have is that i can't see myself finding any free time in the coming week to practice and the concert is on friday. Do you have backing tracks for the things you like to sing?

The farm house ( turned into a holiday flat ) was just superb. Here a few.  That's it. Absolutely quiet, no banging on the new year's eve, no busy roads. Totally. Ferdinand too. We, the tree of us, had a great week there. And didn't even spend much money. Partly. Ferdinand. But we also had meals in a local. Was exceptionally tasty! C'est ca ! Henny:  Dear frances, something beautiful and funny for a good new year! Thanks, a lovely view. Is it near you? That looks superb. Far from maddening crowd? So aiden was a happy dog. Did you cook? Duce france!
Paula: Why do they make this game with super hard levels? It really makes it not fun at all. I just can get past 637 no matter what i do. Brilliant ! Stew: No idea. I hate those. Yep. Did you try looking up the cheats online?
Calum: Oh, please. There's an ad coming up to be a computer investigator and you can earn almost 80 thou. Exactly. Doubtful. Yep. You'd be on the help desk in no time! Lol! Only slightly! Nightmare of epic proportions. Putting it delicately! Bethany: Riiiiight! Where? I mean, that's pretty specialized. Could be true. At any rate, specialized so that equals hard to find a job in. Better than asking if they want fries with that! I can't imagine talking to stupid users all day. No shit! Lol !
Jackie: My sister called me she got pregnant . ( °◇° ). But i am a bit worried about her . ( ーー゛ ) ( ーー゛ ). No, no. Of course not. You know nowadays having kids and raise them takes a lot of money for whole your life. But i don't think my brother-in-law earns enough money for his kids. My sister seemed also worried while she was talking about her pregnancy. Because her plan was to have a baby 2 years later. So it is like, so to speak, well, an accident. Yeah .. i guess you ’ re right . <. Sometimes i feel lucky that i didn't get married yet.ヽ ( ´ー｀ ) ┌. Deadrana: Wow. Awesome ! ヽ ( ^。^ ) ノ. Why? As i know your sister is healthy. Does she have any problem? That ’ s true. At least he doesn ’ t have any debt. I understand you are worried about your sister ( ・へ・ ). Cause she is your sister but your brother-in-law is hardworking guy. Don ’ t worry too much. I can imagine .... I understand. But life isn ’ t going only as you expected. Right? Maybe you can just say only bright future.
Sean: I've never managed it, so i don't think it's even possible. You all make notes, don't you? Nooooo .... how cruel. I think i like to sleep more. I'm just unable to get up so early. How mean ... Joseph: I'm going but it's a nightmare. How do you want to pass the exam sean? So are we! Try at leat once, then we can think about sharing the notes. Question: Are we going to share them with you? Mike: Who's going to the lecture tomorrow morning? We do ... But there is a very important. We all like to sleep, but we keep going there anyway.
Joanna:  Anna: Mum, i have a awful stomachache. Jo. Oh, dear, when did you get it? At night, and it won ’ t stop Jo. Is it something you ate? Maybe. I'm not sure. Jo. What did you have for breakfast? The usual, cereal with milk and a banana. Jo. Maybe the milk was bad. It didn't smell bad. Jo. Maybe the banana was bad. No, the banana was delicious. Jo. Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom. No, that's not the problem. Jo. Maybe it will go away in a little while. I wish it would. Hopefully. If not, maybe we should go and see a doctor. Jo. Yeah, i think so ... I ’ ll get you a hot tea with some fresh mint leaves. Hope it will help. Jo. Please do, i ’ m in my room ... Will be in ten minutes.
Ziggler: Cool, i will. Dolph: Hey. Remember to bring your passport tomorrow.
Kate: Downstairs. Sure, come down. Have you noticed the woman making a cake? Did you see the cake? There was a huge penis on it. Made of marzipan or sth. When i noticed it, i started laughing. So she laughed too. I asked her what's she doing. Somebody ordered a cake with a huge penis with balls and chocolate hair. She is working in the small room under the stairs. Jeff: We're in the little room next to the reception. Sam: Where are you? Already? Yes. I didn't pay attention, why? Hahah, really? Nice. Hahah, i must see it! Right, there is a kitchen.
Larry: Let me take a look at that email and get back to u. Nailed it. God damn it. Post it. It's a sunday. Mate. They're lucky to have you. Let alone him. Don't forget you're doing them all a gravious favor ... let that be clear. I hear that! I hear that too. No argument from me. The current bod has ignored them both. It's insulting. Sadly yes. On a different note. I want to see a menorah in the lobby next year. Kirsten: Agreed. And i am more than happy and willing to chat with'old heads ' on the matter. Can talk about'risk mitigation ' and what not. Ok. sounds good. And let me know what you think and i will pull the trigger and post. Ok. now i got to get my husband to sign off on it since we are referencing him. Oh the married life! Lol. Thank you. I appreciate the confidence. I like to stay busy and i love to learn. So i think this will take care of both. Besides. To be transparent. I honestl don't intend on doing this by myself. I would be a fool not to take input fro jamie and john. They all have a lot of experience and knowledge in the role. Legal action seems to be the only thing they understand. Yes let's try to! I will see if sara has an extra we can out in the lobby.
Chloe: I don't know wheni'm going to be home though. Yes, but i was going to go to megan's house tonight. Mom, seriously. I already told her i was going to come over. Mom, you always do this to me. Ok. Lesley: Can you please go on a walk with the dog when you get home? What do you mean? Doesn't school finish up at 3pm? Chloe, you didn't ask me if you could go. You can not just assume that you are going. Chloe, your dad has to work late tonight. No one is going to be home for a long time. Someone needs to come home and let her out. I am not the one that wanted a dog. You are going to come home and let her out. And that's that. You can go out and see megan afterwards. Thank you .
Jenny: I'm not home. Natalie: Could anybody check if my wallet is in my room? Phew. Tobias: It's here.
Phil: I hear you are looking for me? At the momenti'm on my way from one client to another. Why? What's so urgent? What ?! Well, it'll have to wait till tomorrow. I'm out of town. Let me check. Yep.

Can you be in my office first thing tomorrow morning? Cool. See you tomorrow then.
Martin: Uhhh, babe, we need to talk. I'd rather tell you in person, when can we meet up? I don't know, it just doesn't feel right ... No one! I swear. I mean ... it's not that i want to but ... i guess that depends on you ... because there's something you should know. I'm, well ... i'm asexual. I thought you should know because ... well ... i know it can be a problem in a relationship. I just wouldn't want you to feel unhappy with me. It's not like i can't have sex, but it's just not the same for me as for other guys, i guess. I love you but i want you to be happy, so i thought you should know. Nicole: What's wrong? I'm afraidi'll be kind of busy the next few weeks, a lot of people at my work quit so it's been hell. Can't you just tell me now ?? Oh god, just tell me already !! What is it. Do you wan na break up? Is there someone else? Huh ... you didn't say no to the break up part though. What is it ... you're making me anxious. Well ... i'm a little speechless, that's not what i expected, but i don't think it has to be a problem ... i don't want to break up like this, let's give it a try first.
Mike:  Woke up like this : /. No idea ... probably. But no idea to what : /. Emma: Omg what is this ? ?? Allergy?
David: I want a new tattoo but idk what to get. Ehh i was thinking something on my back maybe a scull and rose?

Peter: Yeah? Dunno. What do you mean? Is it ambulances and stuff? What kind of vans then? Maybe repairs to something? Not until 6 at the earliest, got to finish this presentation for the repairs team tomorrow. No eileen wanted me to do it ... Or because joe did a pretty crappie job last time. I'm almost done, thanks though. Karen: You know that road from the swimming pool to waitrose? What is happening there? It's all blocked of and vans everywhere. Don't think so, i didn't see any lights or anything. I don't know, those big white ones, like work vans. Yeah i guess so. Either way i would avoid it if i were you, i got pretty stuck after yoga. What time are you leaving anyway? I thought joe was going to finish that? Cause she knows you won't say no? True. Let me know if you need any help. See you in a bit.
Matt: Hi! Do you remember what internet connection we have? Rats, me neither and i need it for the application. That's ok, i'll figure sth out, thx. Nick: Sup? Shit, man, i don't know ... I usually just use my mobile service, i don't watch anything when at home. Kk, when i remember it, i'll let you know .
Gabriel: Hey, our tutor wanted to join us. Good idea. Baron: What's up. There is a match next week. Sign on the calendar.  Gavin: Link please? Let's add people from our group.
Jennifer: I think he's just senile. But he's also quite stupid. And the dangerous thing is his self confidence. He's persistence. And ignorance. Mia: God, he keeps talking about the stupid wall. So it's even worse - he's pure evil. We will see. But we should do anything to win the next elections. Peter: Karine is right, i think he's not as senile and stupid as we would like to believe. Possibly yes. Karine: Unfortunately it's much more. This populist strategy to scare people with a minority. And then present himself as the only savior. I really think so, because it's not only about politics anymore. He is destroying the earth. Trying to shake the world's order. But we have a chance to change it. Maybe trump will be over soon? Everything !
Taylor: And children under 12 -- > 50 % off. Madison:  I saw this offer today. Exactly. Tickets cost pretty penny, but the rest is extra cheap. Adam: Thailand ?? Not to expensive ?? Jordan: Seems ok.
Tina: Hey, facebook is constantly non stop suggesting patrick. I think i have to catch a bit of your approach. I have to learn how to transfer from hating men to fucking them haha demi : ( y ).

What do you mean ...? Haha! Yeah. I did it, you're right. But i worked on it hard after a huge heartbreak. Done! But maybe you should chill a bit, look around for ather types ... and see what happens. I know! I know it well! You have to isolate one bit inside that will be always independent. For sure. If youre homeless i will take under my roof. We ll find something tina : < 3. Type: D yes plz do it haha.
Freddie: Nanna, are you coming to visit us soon? I forgott. Well come soon. Yes love you. Leg better soon? Winnie: Oh darling, nanna has broken her leg, you'll have to visit me instead.

Clint: Me! Thats great. Phil: Me too! Mark: Who wants to go and see'batman. New beginning ' this sat at 7? Cool. I can get tickets for us all.
Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room. I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows. Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow. Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls. I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen. I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees. Not necessarily. That would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else. I would install a fan system, or piv system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself. It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. Of course, i will have that done by friday. No problem, speak soon . Betty: Hello andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? Why is that? So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? But not in other rooms? So why only that bedroom and not the other ones? But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then? Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation? So what would you recommend? That sounds good. Would that be sufficient? Ok, is this something your company can help with? Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email? That would be great. And again, thanks for today!
Warren: Yes. Gina: Did u lock the door. Good, thanks.
Claire: Hey. Where's this conference about relations at school? Oh, in sesame street? Thanks! Are you going? I mean apart from your own lecture ; d. I see. Jo's ... is it the one about stress? Ah, this one. Yeah looks interesting. I was thinking maybe mindfullness ... Sounds wonderful. One can easily tell you're one of the organisers ; d. Ok oki'm signing. Up: D see you there, during the breaks at least ; ). Me: D. Aaron: Hey. It's in the teaching training thing. Yeah exactly. Haha yeahi'm giving two, actually. Andi'm kind of a host there as well. So guessi'll be looking to coffee, biscuits etc. I was thinking i could go to jo's lecture. No, that's joe ; d jo is having a workshop on teamwork. I know her, she's a really good coach. Yeah definitely !! If you haven't been to any mindfullness workshops then it's a must! I've taken it in berlin last year, with the same guy. It was amazing, life-changingi'd say. Hahah yeah but we did choose the best topics and presenters, believe. We've checked out all those people and learnt from them and yeah, they're the best ; ). Ok bye bye ; ).
Kate: I've just heard you want to sell your flat ?! Ha ha! I wish .. Sure. You moved in a year ago or so ?! Why do you wan na sell it? It's not that bad. Mine is smaller and i have two. You're right. So are you looking for two bed now? That's sounds reasonable. I can only imagine. It's getting more expensive year after year. Good luck with that ! ; ). Rob: That's true. Do you want to buy it? I'll give you a discount ; ). We're thinking about having a baby and it is too small. There's no room for a cot in our bedroom. Three bed would be perfect so that we won't have to move out again when we decide to have another baby. I know. It just the prices .. total madness ! !! I've got a friend who's relocating to another city so want to sell his flat asap and offers a good price. We're seeing him tomorrow. Fingers crossed ! ; ).
Evan: Yeah i did. He might not come. I will try to make him come. Allison: You talked to ethan about the function? What did he say? Can you do something about that? K.
Daisy: Good, seeing a lot of beautiful places. In naples. No, we took a ferry early in the morning yesterday. Yes, it was nice. But where? But we're heading north now. Rome, florence, venice. No, directly to san fransisco. I know. Wow, are you sure? I am looking forward to it! Charlie: How are you doing. Where are you now? Pity, i hoped you may be still in sicily. I am still thinking about the evening we spent together. I would like to meet you again. Either in the us or here. And you're flying to ny? Too bad. I think i will take a train to florence. More than sure. When are you going to be there? Daisy : 1-5 of september. Perfect. I want to see this amazing city with you. Me too !
Adele: I am still listening to that song. One you recommended me. Yes it is. Omg is it that old? Can you suggest some others from the same singer? When you would come to my home? I am waiting then. Kode: Which one. Yeah thats good one. I have that in my music library for 3 years. Hmm. I give you whole album in usb. I am free right now. Coming.
Maddie: What's the story with claire? Really? I spoke with leah and she told me that you dumped her years ago. Weird. Maybe she was thinking about someone else? I'll ask her next time. Sorry about the confusion. Ian: Claire? I don't know any claire ... Are you sure she was talking about me? I tend to forget things but i do remember my past girlfriends. And believe me none was named claire. Most likely. I barely know her. I think we met for the first time like 1,5 years ago. Don't worry. Take care !
Extreme: O. Violet: Hi! Do you know any good waxing salon in the neighbourhood? I'm going on vacation andi'm as hairy as a. Was it that bad? I was going to get brazilian waxing, but nowi'm scared. Yup. I use scrubs and moisturize my skin almost every day but it's still bad. I mean really bad, i look like a freaking chicken with all these razor bumps. I've tried everything. I just need to man up and make an appointment. Thanks. Paisley: Waxing? Wow, girl, you're. I've been in a waxing salon once andi'm not going back. Waxing is painful af. Leg waxing was ok-ish, but bikini ... jesus. I was bleeding so fckin hard. Blood was everywhere violet : ! !! That's. If i were you, i'd start from leg waxing or sugaring. But why won't you just shave down there? Ingrown hairs? Try shaving with the grain. It helped with my ingrows. Good luck, then ; ). Brave: P. Gorilla: O xd.
Linda: Do i need to ?: P. Done. You're welcome ; ). Suzy: Don't forget to follow me on. Come on, nice pictures ; ).  Instagram: P.
Sean: Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. Let's get those last minute trade request sent. Nick needs to really think about rolling with blake. John needs a qb! Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I guess we will have to talk about after the season. John: I think i would have rights to lamar but i think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guessi'm just hoping rgiii and brock play or just wait ... In 15 yearsi've never seen a ream trade a big time rb or wr for a qb this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one qb team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances. I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year. As i said, we can look at if after the season. I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far . Rick: So does john get lamar jackson or is he scrambling for another qb ?? Crazy it happens though! He one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and nick not to get lamar. People's evidence # 658 why the qb rule doesn't work. Nobody liked my ir suggestion a couple of years ago. That solves a large percentage of the issue tho sean : 1 qb not 2 for a 14 league ...
Lisa: Have you ever heard about this diet ??  Omg, glad that i asked lisa :. Victoria: Nooo. Hmm, seems interesting. Amelia: Yes !! My mum was on that crazy diet ..... she gained 5 pounds ( ー.
Carrie: Just back from fantastic beast. Generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the us. Depends on what you expect really - i have a lot of sentiment towards harry potter so, i'm gon na like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not that good. No worries ; ). And gina, what do you think about eddie redmayne as newt? Not your standard protagonist, that's for sure. Go see it. If ' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ; ). Gina: And what do you think? I agree. I saw it last week and basicallyi'm satisfied. I loved him < 3 i loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character. And that's what i liked about him. Alex: Sounds cool. I was thinking of going this weekend with lane, buti've seen some bad reviews. No spoilers, girls. Maybei'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it.
Emily: Blue, why? A surprise ? = ). I'm super curious. Amelia: What is your favourite colour? I can't tell you. Sort of ... can't tell you anything more. Sorry.
Louis: Yes, she moved there in december. Maria: In southampton. Jenny: Where does mary live now?
Oliver: I'm so happy. Literally thrown out! Or maybe had one too many ; ). Shanon: Yeah. So what bout him? Bt y? What ?! Victor: He's no longer our teacher. I suppose he's had it and lost it. Sid: Me too! He got fired 2day and thrown out of school? Not. Our. Teacher. Anymore !
Pedro: Batman or superman ?? What ?? Whats so good about the. Not anything. Superhuman speed? Thats your pitch? Yeah i get your point. Flash: P. Alex: Honestly .. neither. I honestly like the flash. Duuude, he can do almost anything. Yea im sure batman can run as fast -. That speed opens up the whole multiverse for him .. you seriously dont get how powerful he can be.
Adam: Whoa, that's some fine piece of ass. Where did you find it? Dude, that's creppy. One thing is to send me pic of nice ass, it's always appreciated. But another is to walk around and take pictures on your own. Like some creep. Think about it, she might have been someone's sister or daughter. Shit. Marek: Bro, check this out marek : < file. That's the best part. I didn't find it. I made it in she shopping mall, on the escalator! Adam :? What? Pretty cool, isn't it. Dude. This is some guy's ass. I'm a gay, remember?
Mark: What are we doing tonight? Casino? I will totally get mine this time. Predrinks at your place? Hannah ? ?? I haven't seen her for like 14 years !! She hot?

Dude that's my sister. Okay !
Exams: P. Adrian: Did you get your grades yet? Wait whaaat? Why? Ouch. That must hurt : /. Why don't you re-take the class next year? I didn't do that bad. I ended up with a reasonable grade. I just pay attention during class, i don't study that much actually. Anyway, why didn't you study for the economy final? What happened? Oooohh i know that game but you better stop slacking off. You can play them, just don't loose focus and study for the. Homework: P. Bart: Yeah. My whole semester is screwed up now. Well, i bombed my economy final and ended up with a bad score .. Well, it's my fault because i didn't study as much as i should have. That's what i plan on doing unless i keep screwing up. How did you do this semester? Well someone did his. Classes are boring, can't pay attention for too long ... Let's just say i screwed up more than my econ class. I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time. You're right. I'm not going to play games during school anymore. Let's see how it goes xd.
Don: What did you buy for nancy's birthday? Yvonne: I didn't buy anything yet : /. Margot: A bottle of nice wine.

Tiffany: That would explain a lot. Are you sure you're a turtle? Maybe you're just haunted . Sean: After much thought i ’ ve decided that my spirit animal is a tortoise. Apparently everyone has one now, i only found out about this recently. Tbh i felt lost, like who even am i? After many days of thinking about i finally decided that i am in fact a tortoise. You would be a wasp.
Mary: Good to be back susie is great. I'm so happy.  Thank you. Henry: Good to see you back how is the baby? Have you got any photo? She's sweet! Congratulations.

Lia: Hi, how can i help you? Yes, they are. Well, you can have them delivered to you through courrier - this costs £4 ( pay on delivery ). I'm afraid collecting them personally is a little difficult, as the product can only be collected in garstang ( where the company is located ). Completely new - we also offer grey and pink. Okay, so i just need your address and telephone. Fraid not - company policy. It generally arrives the next day, in rare instances it's longer . Sam:  Good afternoon, is this available? I'm interested in this product. Are the earphones available? Where can i collect them? Okay. Are they new? Do you have any other colors that white? Then i would like the white ones please. The total costs £187 - can i lower the price to £180 ?? Oh, okay. How long does it take for the product to arrive?
Meghan: Oh yes ! ! !! Kelly: Should i put on the red dress? Bloody mary! Mary: I'll wear a red dress too, and bright, red lipstick. Hahahaha.

Nathan: I want to buy myself a bike in spring. I was thinking of hanging it on the wall, there are some special hooks. I don't want to, people who do that annoy me, it's hard to walk around with all these bikes striped to the handrails. Yeah, well i also got a stationary bike so i can be in shape during. Ye, i do like 25 kilometers everyday. My goal for the summer is 100 kilometers. Winter: D. Aubrey: That's great but where are you gon na keep it? Your apartment is so small. You can always keep it in the hallway. I agree ... didn't think about that. Really? I am so proud of you !! That's a lot! Fingers crossed !

Hmm, a little bit but not really. I ’ m more scared to stay in london and do nothing, because i ’ m so bored of it. Well sort of, for fun stuff, but tired of work. Hahah. Thinking of resigning earlier than i was planning. I don ’ t have an answer to that one yet, and it ’ s not really a solution because i ’ d need to work 2 months notice period anyway, but i ’ ve just lost motivation after 3 years. Yes asap. Maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but i don't want to stay there. I know it ’ s not smart to quit without an alternative. True, in my field it wouldn ’ t be good. Anyway i need to speak to my manager and discuss because i ’ m not happy in my job now. How ’ s everything on your side? Too much work? That ’ s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which i had just before i went on holiday. Kai: Hey! I am fine, just working too much. What about you? You travel so much! Where have you been now? Wow! How long? Michael : 2 weeks, lots of flights to make it work. I'm in boston next weekend! Really ? ?! How come? Nice but it's cold. Are you not tired of all this travelling? I see, a man full of energy. Yes, i remember quite well. And then? Would you like to leave london? For the netherlands? Depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also. Yes, i basically never rest these days. Probably, i have a conference 8th of dec, theni'll rest a bit, i hope .
Carol: I got some more fruit from my garden you want some? I have so much i don't know what to do with it. Ugh so don't have the time for that. Really? Thats your argument? Same argument ass.

Agata: Hi, guido. Sure, i'm ok and you? Really? Thanks for the concern all my twitter posts go to my facebook account. I think i might change that! By the way, it's javascript, not java. Except for the name they really have not much in common.  Sorry. After just one month of coding i would be like plain english to. I really do. Finally i found something interesting for me. What about him? Not at all! Why would he? Guido: Hi, agata, are you ok? I just have trouble understanding your posts on facebook. Maybe it's because i don't know anything about java? Don't worry. Sounds like chinese to me. It's hard to understand the concept. I can see that you enjoy it. And what about you husband? Doesn't he complain about your new job? So you don't speak to him in chinese language? I mean in javascript language, hahahha. You: P.

So why you ’ re saying this? Holly: Melissa yes this! Melissa: Of course not! No one is saying men should behave like animals.

Frank: Love you! Zoe : : - *. Have a good day, babe : - *.
Stefano: Hi, josie! So, what about foucault's pendulum? Do you like it? Oh well, in a sense eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino .: P. The name of the rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of italian, you know. Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. Really? What did he say? What? Rotfl! Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum ... I know, it was a typo! Hahaha. You're the one who said it! Josie: Ciao, stefano! It's ... weird. Was it really written by an italian guy? It's so ... nerdy. Yes, i know ... i should try and read one of his novels in the original, buti'm not sure my level of italian is adequate. And what about foucault's pendulum? Btw, i read salman rushdie's review of pendulum, published in the 80s. He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. That's what salman said ... De gustibus! Disgusting pus! Yuk! That's so creepy. I know . ; ).
Evan: Hi dennis, i need to cancel my lesson tomorrow, sorry. Oh, got the flu, been off college since tuesday. Should be ok for next thurs. Bye, den! Thanks . Dennis: Fine, what's up? Ok, just tell me in good time if you can't make it. Hope you feel better soon.

Bobby: U know what annoys me the most? That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs. They may well be, but not for my wallet! I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on. Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses! No, i'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness i have never heard of. So i did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution. I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. So i put my mind to it and do u know what i came up with? That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products! Absolutely! Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast? Right? Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today? At least $ 1.2 bln! Mickey: Not being able to watch tv or listen to music without pesky interruptions? Y? Aren't they good 4 ur health? What do u mean? And what of it? What? Are u sure? So what? There are many illnesses and diseasesi've never heard of. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. All right, this is quite serious. What? Srsly ?! How long do u think they've been lying to us? That is kinda puzzling. So why is no one doing anything about it? No. Explains a lot .
Greg: Hey man. I do. But i doubt they are better than yours. Your the best man! Smartass. Buti'm grateful to know such a smartass. True. Thanks ! Dave: Hey, do you have any notes from statistics?

We are going to visit the german markets this weekend. Birmingham and manchester both. Sausage overload! Allegedly there are christmas things going on but i just go for the sausage and beer! I know! Oh, yeah, they are good. Try the mulled wine too. That's nice. Yes, exactly. And lots of spices. Usually a red but sometimes they offer a mulled white. Inspired us to make our own at christmas last year, but nobody else drank it. More for me! But oh the hangover. Anyway, that's the plan. Hope you have fun. Thanks !

Fixed it - absorbed juls extra cost so we can remove her from the group again. True that - let me know when you are doing that andi'll add her back in. No worries, we got this. I guess by the end of the month – something unpredicted always pops up in the meantime so we have to recalculate again. Sara, george. Luke: Probably have to delete that expense and re-add it. It's the car right? George: We will, my man. Iris: Anyone know how to fix this? Trying to remove myself from an expense : > this expense involves a person who has left the group, and thus it can no longer be edited. If you wish to change this expense, you must first add that person back to your group. Doesn't say. But probably juls? I ’ m gon na try. Gracias.
Kurt: Sure no prob, call me. Ola: Hey running late. I should be free by 8.
Conny: Hello mr. fitz. It's about this paper you told me to write for next week. I did some research. And frankly, i found pretty much nothing. Mostly internet, obviously. Sure, everything should be there. You did? Doubt it. Buti'll go mr. fitz. Obviously . Fitz: Hello, conny. What can i do for you? What about it? Where did you do your research, conny? Obviously?

Jess: Guys, last night i dreamt i was a lion tamer, does it mean i should go to africa this summer? Xd. Knowing my luck, charlie might be the closest to the truth. No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that i had to share it with you ; ). Do you believe in dreams, lynn? I guess? So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood? Lynn: Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper ?: D. You've just spoiled all the fun !: P. Well ... I'm not saying i believe, but i think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think? Wow, it sounds really cool ! Charlie: Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat? Do you really believe that dreams can mean something? I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream. Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Articles: Monica :,. Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From whati've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but i don't think may lead to your death. I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me. When it comes to intolerance ... i know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but i don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, i think you're fine. But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better. You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food? It may be, buti'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm. Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance? Hm, i don't know, i feel that i may be allergic or something. I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and i gain weight even though i don't eat much. I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare. I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My gp said all my problems are linked to my diet. Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and i have no idea what's happening with me. Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong? My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine. But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this? Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those. I did the same thing with lactose, i wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it andi'm much better now. It just happened, i was all right until i wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens. You should read the articles i sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat.

A host from lbc tried to find an answer to an unanswerable question : `` who is james charles ? ''. Eventually james called him and introduced himself. On air .: D. Right ?: P.
