Benjamin: Hey guys, what are we doing with the keys today? Hmm I might actually pass by at lunchtime, take the keys and go take a nap. I'm sooo tired after yesterday. YAAAAWN peak-no-evil. Interesting ace_screaming_in. All these terrible obstacles on mu way to bed might just prove to much to take. Hilary: I've got them. Whoever wants them can meet me at lunchtime or after. Yeah, I guess so. Sounds good. We'll be having lunch with some French people (the ones who work on the history of food in colonial Mexico - I already see you yawning your head off). So I'm meeting them at the entrance to the conference hall at 2 pm and then we'll head to this place called La Cantina. Italian cuisine, which is quite funny, but that's what they've chosen. Oh come on ace_with_tears_of. We'll try to avoid talking about their subject of research. Oh wait, no, I'm actually meeting them because I wanted to chat about their research lol. Do join us, we're going to have fun. And then you'll take the keys and take this most deserved of naps.  miling_face_with. Elliot: I'm ok. We're meeting for the drinks in the evening anyway and I guess we'll be going back to the apartment together?  ear-no-evil. Sounds like a plan ace_with_tears_of. See you at 2 then xx. Daniel: I'm with Hilary atm and won't let go of her for the rest of the day, so any option you guys choose is good for me. Monkey: Where and where are you meeting?  Fear: To be honest, Hilary, I almost feel like changing my mind. Wanting to take this nap might end up costing me to dear. Joy:   Sunglasses:

What about me? Yes and no. I like browsing, trying on, looking in the mirror and seeing how I look, but not always buying. Isn't it obvious? ;). If I bought everything I liked, I'd have nothing left to live on ;). Lol. Well, I have 2 things I must struggle to resist! Clothes, ofc ;). Books. I absolutely love reading! Everything I can get my hands on. Yup .
Rita: I'm so bloody tired. Falling asleep at work. (. The time just keeps on dragging on and on and on. . . . I keep on looking at the clock and there's still 4 hours of this drudgery to go. I'm really not cut out for this level of boredom. Tina: I know what you mean. I keep on nodding off at my keyboard hoping that the boss doesn't notice. . Times like these I really hate my work. Neither am I. .
Beatrice: I am in town, shopping. They have nice scarfs in the shop next to the church. Do you want one? But you don't have a scarf. Last winter you had a cold all the time. A scarf could help. Actually, I don't care. You will get a scarf. You were complaining the whole winter that you're going to die. I've had enough. Leo: No, thanks. Because I don't need it. I don't like them.

Well, they say how you end things shows how you really are. . . Gotcha! It's only two weeks left, so grit your teeth and do what you have to do. Come on, stop thinking, start doing!
Clara: Hi, what you up to? Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it! Miling_face_with_heart. Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence. That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio. Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too. It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand. Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that. Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies. Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it! Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4! Bye! . Neela: Not much, chilling out. Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good? Why is it called Dear White People? Yeah, but why is it so good? I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then? How's that? Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens? Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon! Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People. See ya, love! Eyes: 
Ernest: Hey Mike, did you park your car on our street? Ok good. Someone just crashed into a red honda looking just like yours. Mike: No, took it into garage today. Why? Lol lucky me.
Deirdre: Hi Beth, how are you love? Wondered if you had any thought about your Mum's 40th, we've got to do something special! Sounds fab! Get your thinking cap on, it's only in 6 weeks! Bet she's dreading it, I remember doing that! Well, it was a lovely surprise! Gosh, thats nearly 4 years ago now, time flies! What was the favour, darling? Well, I am looking for Saturday girls, are you sure about it? You could do well in the exams and go on to college or 6th form. What about a tutor? Kira could help you in the hols. I know. Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat. Its not for the squeamish, mind. Massage, pedicures, not to mention waxing! Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes. We can try a few hours on a Saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. If you like, we'll take it from there. Bye, lovely girl! Xx. Beth: Hi Auntie Deirdre, I'm been meaning to message you, had a favour to ask. How about a girls weekend, just mum, me, you and the girls, Kira will have to come back from Uni, of course. Oh yeah, we had a surprise party for you, you nearly had a heart attack! Oh, it was just that I fancied trying a bit of work experience in the salon, auntie. I know, but it's not for me, auntie, I am doing all foundation papers and I'm struggling with those. Maybe, but I'd like to try working. I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough. Yes, thanks auntie. I'd really like to try the beauty therapy side. Oh yes, I was chatting to a friend about it yesterday! Yes, I'd really like that. OK, I like the sound of it! See you tomorrow Auntie! Love you!
Gloria: This exam is a bit of a lottery in fact. You can't really get prepared, it's all about experience. You can see some texts from previous years. <file_other> Yes it's very good. Actually it's good to read all the texts because you will see that some phrases repeat very often. 4 hours. Well it has to be. Would be perfect to have 2 more hours. . . But on the other hand it would be really exhausting. No breaks So it's really important to be really focused and try to write as fast as you can. And read it carefully and correct during the last hour. Emma: But there are some rules and some typical texts right? Wow that's very useful. I have never seen this site. How much time do you have for all 4 parts? Is it enough? 4 hours and no breaks? I'm going to read everything from that website, it's great.
Adam: Have you talked to May? I just talked to her and I must admit I worry about her. No wonder. . . She was telling me she doesn't feel like doing anything, she's bored all the time, she never feels happy. It sounds like a real, typical depression. She also told me that she has trouble sleeping. I asked her to go out for a beer or anything basically, but she doesn't want to leave the flat. I was wondering how I can help her. Yes, but she doesn't want to see a specialist. Basically, she doesn't want to see anyone. Sounds rational, do you know anyone you could call? Don't mention her name. Thank you Karen! . Karen: Yes, yesterday, why? Me too, I suggested she should see a specialist, but she wasn't very happy about it. I know, but I think this is serious. She's saying she's depressed, like everyone around, but in her case it may be true. Oh my, it sounds really serious. I don't what to tell you. Honestly I don't know if we can help her, Adam. I suggested a specialist because these are very sensitive issues and I'm afraid we may unintentionally make it worse. Hm. . . I don't know. . . How about I call someone for advice? So we could know what to do. Of course I won't! I have a friend who's a psychologist, we can trust her. I'll let you know.
Anne: You were right, he was lying to me. Yeah, he told me he's 30, today I saw his passport - he's 40. He lied to me Irene. Irene: Oh no, what happened? You sure it's so important? Jane: Who? That Mark guy?
Augustine: Guys, remember it's Wharton's bday next week? Wtf? ! ? So much fun. 2moro ok? Darlene: Yay, a party! Cool with me. We can shred some papers at the party. Walk, ask him if he really wnts it and if he yes then we get it. But better ask him twice. And sure ask ab the party! . Heather: Yay! Crap we need to buy him a present. Whatever that make him happy. Srsly guys, you mean we should really get office equipment? ? ? Walker: He mentioned paper shredder once. He did really. For no reason at all. I heard him say that. Wasn;t drunk. Me neither. Will do.
Ollie: Okay, Kelly! Ur up nxt! What's scary about sculptures? Wait! Do they resemble vampires and stuff? Another one? Nagoro village in Japan! Well, maybe it's not scary, but it similar to Kelly's place. It's just creepy as hell. Imagine a village with ppl living in it. And in the same village u have these human-sized figures. And there's more of them than the ppl that actually live there! See! Mine was the worst! Point taken. Cu! . Kelly: Me? I don't wanna. Fine. It's a sculpture garden in Finnland. It's not the sculptures, it's the amount of them and their faces! Well, they resemble ppl in different activities like hugging, training, doing sport and so on. But the faces are just morbid and there's like a hundred of them. All staring at you! Creepy AH! Yeah, me too. Bye! Mickey: C'mon! Nah, I'm sure they look rly nice. Certainly! Y? WTF? ! Y would ppl even do that? Listen, guys, fun talking to u, bt gotta go. Jessica: Yeah! What's yours? Faces? What faces? Well, Ollie, ur turn! Bt y? Idk. Idc. Never. Going. There. Bt not the scariest! Bye!
Myah: <file_photo> <file_photo> Selah: I can't see the phone number very well. Rewrite it plz. The phone of that person is off.
Eric: Hey Bella, What happened today in boss's room? ? Was he angry? ? REALLY! ! He appreciated this decision. . What could possibly lead to this? ? I mean , they were potential clients. . . Oh that could possibly be the reason. Well anyways you got appreciation xD congo	. Bella: NO NO! ! ! He wasn't angry at all. . He actually appreciated on our brave deccision to dismiss the request of client. . Yeah he really did. . I too was astounded by his reaction. . . What he told me was that he was looking forward to bring in new clients which were our current client's competitor. . Hahaha Blessing in disguise xD.
Ben: Where are you? Why? Good idea. Around 4. 30 PM. Right, we will see. Sure. Sleep well. Emma: At the rare of the bus. There are some free seats here. So I can have a nap even. When are we going to arrive to NY? If traffic is not crazy. Could you come here and wake me up around 4. 15? Thanks! I'll try.
Jesse: I have an idea that'll cheer u up! I was thinking about doing something 4 the less fortunate this year. U'll get ur presents, no worries ;). Well, have u heard about the Refuge? That's right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. Have a look at these 3. Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one. So it's settled? Melvin: What is it? Bt what do u have in store? That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children? That's a great idea! What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage. But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. Yup. Lee: Gr8 idea! Anything in mind? No. What's that? Count me in! I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange. Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. Sure. Maxine: So no presents 4 me? Phew! Was getting a bit worried for a moment ;). I think I've heard of them. So what about them? Me too. Agree. I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it. Fine. . Lists: <file_other> <file_other> <file_other>
Mary: Hey, im kinda broke, lend me a few box. Cool, thanks. Carter: Okay, give me an hour, im at the train station.
Charlotte: Hello Paula, a funny. And the stress on the second syllable? Or the first? Thank you dear. Lovely to hear your voice! !  . Question: How do you pronounce'Natal lily', the name of the plant? It refers to the region of ZA and not to the word'natal' as in'his natal day', right? Paula: Hi Charlotte, 'nu tell', 'nu' as in'number'. 2nd. <file_other>  <file_other>
Jack: Cocktails later? Possibly a little tightly strung today? Thought so. Maybe two! . May: YES! ! ! You read my mind. . . Sigh. . . Without question. A little drink will help!

It's fucking brilliant! ! ! Dan, are you playing? You have to give it a go, I was sceptical at first, but. . . Omg, wait for Dorian. Oh yes. Lucas: Is it any good? I played just DA II. Is it better than 2?
Judy: Why am I always attracted to jerks? ? He just wanted to fuck me. When he got what he wanted he stopped calling and texting. He’s sweet. Maybe too sweet for me…. He’s a lovely and caring guy but I don’t feel the butterflies… . Janice: It didn’t work out with Andrew? And Bruce? He’s not a jerk.

THE meeting? Sure, let me know how did it go. Ala: Oh yes, I know, that's for purpose. It's how it's suppose to be. They pay a lot of attention to the image. Oh, poor you. Pfff. And I'm on my way to a meeting. Yes, keep your finger crossed. Ok darling, in touch.
Sebastian: It's been already a year since we moved here. This is totally the best time of my life. Yeah! Totally maaan. During this 1 year I learned more than ever. I learned how to be resourceful, I'm learning responsibility, and I literally have the power to make my dreams come true. Exactly! That's another part of my life that is going great. Don't worry about it. I have a feeling this day will come shortly. This one year proved to me that when you want something really badly, you can achieve it. If you devoted your life to analyze all of the winning numbers, and with your math skills you could win. Something like that xD. Thanks. It means a lot my friend . Kevin: Really? It's great to hear that. It's great that you are satisfied with your decisions. And above all it's great to see that you have someone you love by your side. I wish I had such a person by my side. Haha. I don' think so, but thanks. I want to win lottery and I never did. Devote myself and million dollars for lottery tickets. I'm happy for you man. I really am.

Ola: Hello Kate, sorry for not keeping in touch properly. As expected, we have hardly any connectivity here in Cuba. But we're doing fine and enjoying our trip. How are the things at home? NO! ! ! It's one of my favorites! The one from Laos! Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs. <file_photo> Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually crappy. I might try and find some. Would you like one too? OK I'll have a look. Greets to everyone at home pls. Kate: At long last! Started to worry. Nothing new happening, if you disregard all that Xmas craze. Momo has recovered from her injury and frolicking again. <file_photo> Good old Momo! Yes, it is your scarf! Too late. Momo thinks it belongs to her now. Get yourself a new one. They surely have nice ones there. Wait a sec! <file_photo> Isn't it similar? ! Mum would probably like it. Why don't you? And if you go to some boutique shop or something? Not at a market as in your pics? Not really. And Mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic Cuban blouse ). Take care! .

Lola: Hey girlfriend, what's up? Another one? How did the others react? No fighting? That's new. Especially girl dogs, probably. Doggies, right/. Haha. True though. Cute. Can't wait to see him. . Adele: Oh, hi Lols, not much. Got a new dog. Yup. A pup biscuit lab. 4 months. Chewy. The cats keep their distance, Poppy and Lulu seem to mother him. Speedy wants to play. They say puppies are accepted by other animals more easily than older dogs. With the other ones I had to wean them because I took them in as adult dogs. And girls like to fight. Like crazy. That too. I know, right. Anyway, called him Bones. He's so plump it kinda fit.

Petra: I need to sleep, I can't stand how sleepy I am. I'm sleeping with my eyes open, kill me. She would kill me on spot without batting an eye. It's hard to believe she can move, but let her have whatever belt she wants. Sooooo sleepy. Andy: I know, and it's so boring today, nobody's working at the office. Ask the fat woman from HR. She always repeats she has a black belt in karate. LOL. Ezgi: I am working! Lazy pigs.
Nick: You look absolutely gorgeous and have a lovely smile. Would love to get to know you a bit more. How about we meet up for a drink sometime? Why would you think that hon?

You're shooting a bit above your range aren't you? Because I'm not that desperate. Oh is your poor little dick shriveling at the thought? Bye loser! You're welcome! .

Against whom? I’m not surprised he didn’t tell you. And? Does it change anything? . First: I assumed you knew. Second: Why would I? It’s not my business.

Jayden: But I don't need kids. Kids means over. At least for a woman. The end of normal life. Being pregnant, suffering because of this etc. Being obligated to be with the. 24h. Men have only sex and they wait for kids while women suffer. I wish I could do the same. Then probably i would say the same like u. Physical suffering. No one can do anything with this. I wish I could just have sex and wait for a baby while having a normal life. Not getting fat, having the same body, the same breast and not disgusting . . . Not feeling sick, not having pain, being able to do every day stuff even like walking. . . I was I'm a store, behind me there was a pregnant woman, she dropped some money and she couldn't even take them from the floor. . . I had to help her. I hope that maybe soon they will be possible to have a child without being pregnant. Yes! And she's suffering. While a man is doing his normal stuff. U mean the conversation? Would be awesome. I said I don't want to have any children now! Maybe in the future when I have a good job, I'm financially independent. Good night. Brennan: Over what ? Hmm so I need to look for another mother to my kids then. Haha. I don't agree. . . Guys like me would be there through it all to reduce the suffering. It's gonna happen eventually. That's because she's about to give birth. Any I'm sorry for feeding you with my bullshit. I hope you find a guy that can give you the sex you want and not get pregnant. I'm gonna go to sleep now. Good night.

Us all dressed up with our long dresses and the men with their frilly evening shirts, lovely memories! No, but I heard that Marigold Carter died, very sad. Actually, I was thinking along those lines!

It is still pretty tense…. My dad left my mum for his secretary. Such a cliché. My mum is devastated. So I’m basically going to cheer her up. It’s really hard for her now. For me it’s also not easy.

Maxwell: Thank you for tonight, payment as usual? What would I do without you…. But you can do your job good or bad… I’m grateful I found you. And the kids… They really like you. Wait, I heard there was some problem with Marcus at school…. Oh, ok, the teacher sounded like it was something terrible. That’s worse… Have you noticed him behaving in a strange way recently? For example? Yes, I understand, I need to do something about it. Anyway, thank you for informing me. We could grab a coffee some time and talk through all the issues. OK, thanks, you're the best . Jeanice: Yes, 8 hours. That’s my job. Me too, our cooperation is very good ^^. I know, they’re cute. Nothing very serious, he argued with a friend but they didn’t fight. In a way it was, he didn’t want to stop when a teacher reacted and he was pretty aggressive. Not at all, cute as usual. But… he gets very angry for stupid reasons. You know, his sister taking sth from him… He’s not aggressive but more… loud than usual, if you know what I mean. No problem Mr. Hall, I’m always here to help ;). Yea, maybe, I have to go, I'll let you know.
Mike: Let's go for a beer. Yes. Tom: Now? Ben: Ok.
Leah: I've just met the creepiest guy on the earth. Last night i went to the poetry reading. This guy approached me, introduced himself and we started talking. He was rly boring, but, you know, i didn't want to be rude, he didn't seem to be a psycho, so i kept talkig to him. At one point he mentioned that "we have something in common", because we both speak german. I was. He just brushed it off and kept talking. At one point he asked me about an event i had attended and he NAMED ALL OF MY FRIENDS THAT HAD COME WITH ME. Of course i didn't tell him about it. I asked him once again how did he know about all this stuff and he said that he googled me out. Right? ! And now the best part. He googled me out, because he thought that i had a crush on him, because 2 weeks earlier I LIKED A POST ON FB announcing that he was going to accompany poets on the guitar during the poetry reading. Can you believe this? ! AND he tried to walk me home, even though i told him straightforward that he was a creep. Samantha:  i'm all ears. Charming. Wow, that's creepy as hell. What did you do? WHAAAAT? I googled people out before, but i’m not that stupid (and creepy) to tell them about it. LOOOOOOL. Men are fckin weird. Girl, you're lucky that he didn’t kill you, what a psycho. I would totally freak out. Like: "erm, ok, how do you know about this, i don't know you, i didn't tell you about this".
Dave: Hey, is Nicky still at your place? Her phone is off. Thanks! . Sam: She just left.
Ken: Fuck you, you pimp. Fuck you man, I want my money back. No, I'm the prankster, just having a laugh at your expense. Greg: What? Was your account hacked by some prankster? Well, fuck you too then XD.
Alexander: Personal request to send me message when you will be in taxi. If any problem, call me. Taxi confirmation below. <file_photo> Good but bad. Tom: ;). Thank You, I appreciate it. Thank you for the transport, we arrived safely, although without luggages. Yeeees.
Asher: Have you seen there're 5 (! ) bouncy castles in the hall? And a HUGE bouncy dragon! ! <file_photo> What’s the occasion? That's so cool! . Shane: Wow! it looks fantastic. The university organised a carnival party for children. Or at least this is what i heard in the dean's office.
Ian: Honey, do not you know where my green folder is? I was sure I left it on the dining room table. Ok, thx . Sophie: Green? I have no idea. Maybe Alex put it somewhere. Ask her.
Adrian: Can you talk? Not that much. I'll you then. Simon: Not really, anything important? I'll be free at 5.
Jen: I think I'm through with the dickhead. He's being a pain again. I'm going to tell him to move out. No. He's freeloading and said he has no intention of giving back my money because I don't deserve it with the way I act. I've learnt to hate him with a passion. He's like vermin that you can't cull. Abusive, nasty, annoying, irresponsible. He disgusts me. Yeah you were absolutely right. . As always. I seem to pick them, don't I? Sometimes I think it is my fault. If only I could be a better person, if only, if only. . . . What if he doesn't leave? I'm afraid of asking him to leave'cause it will only cause another fight. Yeah, you're right. . . But how do I get out of this mess? Easier said than done. Yeah you're right. Sometimes I just don't have the strength. Jane: Did he at least give you back the money he owes you? He has a nerve doesn't he? How dare he? ! ! ! Get rid of him! I told you right from the beginning that he's no good. I hate to say it but I can smell a fucktard a mile away. You know that way of thinking will get you nowhere fast. It's self defeating. That's what the abusers want you think that you're bad and you deserve every bit of abuse that they dish out. You can't spend your whole life walking on eggshells. I think you've got to cut your losses and just move on. I know. You've gotta do it Hon. If you don't things will only get worse. Think of how much worse they've already got since you met him. I believe in you. Please do it! Remember I'm always there for you. .
Dean: Hey sweetheart. What's for dinner tonight. What do you mean you dunno. Nooo whyy I'm starving. I guess I will! What would you like me to get for you? ? ? ? You won't? What's up? Where are you going to be tonight then?  Why.  Poppy: Hey. Dunno? Well, I'm not preparing anything tonight. So I dunno. Grab something on the way back home. Nothing I won't be home tonight. Yeah I won't. Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow. Not telling. Because it's a secret.   .
Gab: Ah that's better. Now we can message all we like. So when can we meet up for a drink? I'd love to meet you in real life. Why not? But you're talking to me, aren't you? How so? But it would be so much nicer to do this cuddled up right next to you. . . Are you there? Where did you go? Kat? . Kat:  ). Fairly busy at the moment so I'm not sure when. I don't meet strange men from the internet. Not that sort of gal. Yes, but that's different. Just is. I think this was a mistake.
Agatha: My presentation is ready as we speak. Economics. Definitely, I used recent research. I'm just really into economics. Adam: Oh cool, what course? Is it interesting? I mean. . . Your presentation. Sounds like you know what you're doing. No doubt about that.

How much are they? When is the gig? Well, I may go. Ok! Let's go! It'll be an unforgettable evening! Done. .
Andrew: Hello Bez, this morning I wanted to take your car and go to Krizingen but it showed "low brake fluid level". So I went only to the garage next to Willig and they said it's ok, probably a display error. Do you want me to have the car checked properly? Have you got a contract with some garage in particular? Kate took your car today, just to check, and everything was fine. It must have been in fact display error. Hi Bez, when are you back? What date? Hello Bez, just as we thought. No internet. Everything is fine here, also the car. The plants in the basement are watered once a week but not too much. <file_photo> Your natal lily has just started to flower. And look at. <file_photo> Greetings from your frost-bound garden! Bez: Hello Andy and Kate! Sorry for not replying immediately. We have here no wifi internet connection. I'm in a hotel lobby now and use a "phone credit". The car should be ok as it passed general inspection only in June. I usually go to a garage in Crinch. But don't bother as long it shows no more alarms. Apart from that is everything alright? Automatic lights going on and off? One downstairs, one upstairs. Please don't forget to give the plants in the basement an occasional drink! Thank you. I'm home on the 21st in the evening. Could you please switch the heating on a bit on that day? Thank you Andy! .

So if I only add 3 items, I will always get the same results? I just don't get it. Every morning I approach my wardrobe, open it, choose the clothes I want to wear or prepare them the previous day and that's it. I don't need an app to tell me what to wear with what. You're not going to make me cut my fingers off? 5 or 6. T-shirts or regular shirts? 3 or 4. 2. All right. It's slowly dawning on me. .

You're a little ray of sunshine, aren't you? ;). I don't know, I just like to think that we get numerous second chances to change our lives, to make right what's wrong. That's it, I don't have any better explanation. Thanks! . Brooklyn: Same to you! Have you made any New Year's resolutions? ;> Really? So how you're going to change your life this year? Hmm, interesting especially the last point ^^. Yeah, just one - not to make any resolutions. I just don't believe that a new year means a fresh start. Every past year I told myself I would lose weight, quit smoking, start going to the gym etc. And I'm still a fatty, who smokes like a chimney and rarely leaves their couch.  And you're an undaunted optimist. What makes you believe that everything is going to change for the better? Well, you haven't convinced me. Nevertheless good luck with all your resolutions. ;).
Trevor: I've got a bit of a problem, Uncle. Yes, Uncle I need to get you advice on how to break this to Dad. That's the long and short of it, Uncle. Well, it's her father's fault, Uncle. Yes, Uncle. She has sneaked me into the house really quietly and we are in her bedroom doing it. And we haven't got any condoms so I am planning to pull out at the last moment. So I am just pulling out and all of a sudden in bursts her father and delivers me such a kick up the arse that I am back in there coming. Yes. Richard: Have you, Trevor? You haven't gone and got that Abigail up the duff have you? Shit. How did that happen? Her father's fault? And him a church pastor? Fucking hell. Do go on.  So you say it is all his fault, then? Incredible. So maybe we can get him to pay the child support instead of you then, eh? . Unbelieveable: Bloody idiot. What then?
Julia: I mean I like my Instagram. And my Snapchat. Oh and Twitter. And sometimes Facebook. Neither am I. I like looking at photos of my friends and sharing stuff with them. And I think they like it when I post stuff. Rly? Rly? Intriguing. Wasn't she on one already? I always thought she was training day and night! Yeah. She just wouldn't shut up about it. She posted every single thing she could find on the subject! And all the time I thought she was so active and pro-active and charitable. She had me fooled ;). Speaking of which, did u spy on me? It's fun? Gr8. What do u mean? I know that's y ppl like what I do, 'caus I genuine. What's that supposed to mean? That bitch! Gail: So do I. But this doesn't mean I'm addicted. I certainly do. And I like to spy on ppl. Yeah! It's a lot of fun! Like I was spying on Em and turns out she's into some guy from work ;). I know! and Jessica is thinking about going on diet. Nah. Whenever she posts a lot of fitness-related stuff, she's just thinking about, but doing nothing rly. Nah. That's just how she is. The more she posts, the less she does. Like she had a phase for animal shelters. Remember? Right. And turned out that was everything she did. Never visited one. Never donated a dime. Never did anything. U see? Spying on ppl is fun. No, y would I? Oh no! Don't get me wrong! We talk all the time, so no need to spy on u ;). Besides ur pretty straightforward. When ur eating, u post food. When ur training, u post fitness materials or photos. When ur relaxing, u post a bunch of stuff. Yeah. . . Hillary thinks u overdo it and have no life in real life. I know! .
Anne: I hate that bitch! Yesterday she called Tom, was all sweet with him you know how she can be. . . . I think that's why she did it. She wants to take Tom away from me.

Lily: I spent an amazing night with this guy. Thomas. He is Romanian, but from an extremely rich family, it seems. LSE. Hahah, but I expected him to be more banal and boring. To be more mediocre. . . In everything. I've had so much pleasure that I have a headache. Haha, I agree! . Kate: What's his name? Is he English? What does he do in London? Of course, so predictable. But? In size, in passion or in wallet? I'm glad to read that. You deserved some fun after the last weeks.

Hayden: Anyway I have 1 month to write my thesis. And then I need to decide what studies I should choose and I have a problem because I don't know what I can do in the future to make good money. And the only studies I'm interested in are African studies but I'm not sure I can make big money later on haha except for working in the embassy or something like that. I was thinking about working as a flight attendant. It would be easy for me to get that job since I can swim (and here it's obligatory) I'm even a water rescuer. I know English italian and polish and a bit of german. But to be honest , I don't think so that job is so great. I can't work there forever and I'm not that sure I wanna risk every time hahah since flight accidents happen. But I don't wanna die hhahahahah. Margaret: You'll find something. So go ahead for it. Hahahaha you shouldn't think about that. It would be good you would get to travel a lot.
Alan: <file_photo> Look what I just found. Yeah, I know - that's awesome. Well, and I found a perfect company for it <file_photo> Actually it does taste surprisingly well. The cinnamon is not overpowering. If you put enough whiskey that is. Ah, that is true . Robert: Dude, that's just nasty and you know it. It has no sugar, no taste, and additional cinnamon flavoring. You sir have a very strange tastes. Oh, that's more like it! But does the whiskey go well with the cinnamon? Flavored whiskey is the worst. . . Rob: Lol, thought so. I just wish the brought the old cherry flavor back. . . Not the useless no-sugar stuff.

They're just TV shows don't take them too seriously. X. Greg: I'm watching House of Cards though must admit the new series is boring. Netflix original Bodyguard is supposed to be good from what I've heard. Mike: I agree. Not the same without Kevin Spacey! You should try The West Wing if you enjoy political dramas.

I can get you in contact with the landlady too if u want. Its this old basque lady, widow, pretty lonely but nice. She even made a tortilla for us. Yes she rents a room in the appartment. Well think about it and let me know.
Malik: Have you heard of that paleo diet? I need to lose some weight and i really want to try it. What are you talking about? ! ? Lol. You're so skinny. Should we try one of those together? It's always easier when someone's doing it with you. We can also go for runs together like we used to D. So paleo or keto? I think they're practically the same, but you can't have dairy on paleo. I think you can, i'm no sure though. Ok. Are you excited? ? Samantha: I've heard of it buti've also heard about the keto diet. AAAAANNNDDDD. . . I also need to lose weight lol. Whatever ). YES! ! ! !

Derek: It's been a long day. Very busy. I closed some deals but I had a lot of stress also. Phil: Same here. Lucky you. I couldn't close any deal. It annoys me. Some customers are negotiating for days, weeks. And then they pull out. That's what they do . Cynthia: Good or bad? Maybe they're just fishing. Want to compare offers.

Lisa: Hello Peter. What have you been doing off late? Too much of work, huh?  Ohh, trying to get in shape?  That’s a good thought. I was also thinking of working out a bit. What do you do? Do you go to a Gym? Which exercises do you do regularly?  Besides exercises, I think I need to eat better to help me keep in shape.  There are a lot of things we can do to stay healthy. Peter: Bit busy with work. Not really, I’ve been working out. Nah, I don’t have much of weight to lose, just want to improve my health. Yes, I hold a membership with the one near our office. I do weights and run on the treadmill. Another major requirement for good health is sleep. On an average one requires at least 7-8 hours of sleep. Yes. One needs to maintain a regime to stay healthy for a long term. .

Don: The CSS tests are today. No, not yet. Hmm. . . I don't know. I'll check it later tonight when I get home. Apparently it's supposed to be a database of all the young up-and-coming hockey stars. Scouts use that information for future contracts, etc. Well, obviously not, but it's kind of cool that they'll be in a world database of peewee hockey players. Bring a blanket It can get mighty cold sitting in a rink for 3 hours. Well, since you're going anyway, maybe you can take my kid. I'll take the kids next time, I promise! Ok, thanks again, I owe you. . Hank: I know! Have you registered in their system? I'm not sure if I have to fill out all the fields. Most of them don't even apply to Rodney. It's strange that they're incorporating such professional tests for little leaguers. OK, but our kids are 10 years old! They're not signing any contracts for now. Yeah, I guess. So apparently the tests are supposed to last 5-8 pm. 3 hours! I'll probably wait and work on the computer. No shit Are you coming. Hey, that's not fair! Yeah, yeah, we'll see. I'll tell you about the tests when I bring Oscar and Roger back.

I told them I'm allergic and they ensured me there's not even a trace of peanuts. I started swelling after the first bite - apparently there were crushed nuts in the crust. I just don't get how ignorant you have to be to do something like this. Eddie: Why? You love this place. Dear god what happened? ! Are you all right? Oh no they didn't. . . I think you should sue them. They really could have killed you. Anne: We've just been there with Jane and Ella. Now we're getting out ER.

Rory: Hey Mitch, how are you? I hope you're doing ok. We are thinking of signing up Bill for that International camp. Sammy will be going too. Do you think it would be possible for you to take Bill and Sammy if you go down? Great, that would mean a lot to us. Thanks a lot. Of course, we'll chip in for gas. Ok, no problem. Ok, great. I know, it's crazy. Do you know exactly which date you'll be leaving? Ok, cool. It's such a long drive. That's a pretty ambitious undertaking.

Harriette: Have you ever gone ghost hunting? ;o. Yeah, once when I was in high school! There was a run-down building in the neighbourhood and we went to investigate it with my friends. We didn't see any ghosts, haha. But let me tell you that I never thought I'd freak out this much at hearing a cat meow. There's just something about the atmosphere. . . That makes you overreact and find normal but unexpected things really creepy. Yeah, if I could choose again, I'd probably still decide to go - I don't regret it! But I definitely wouldn't try something like that alone ^^;. Jamie: Ghost hunting? Nah, not really. . . Have you? How was it? Did you find something? I guess that's part of the experience?
Jack: Kev, I need your help? I can't get the application running. Very funny! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Yeah, man. It is f**cking serious. Thanks. . Kev: What's up, mate? Have you switched the computer on? OK. Sorry. I can see it's serious. I'll be with you right now.

Shaldona: WE ARE GONNA GET MARRIED ed_heart red. <file_others> This is our mobile inviation for our wedding. Invitation*. . . . . . Well. . I had no enough time to meet everybody and give this in person. Hope you understand. Heart:  Piper: Hey. You haven’t sent me any messages for a few years.

Jeff: Do you know guys anything about the agreement? Sure, it's rich in resources. Hahaha, right! . Vladimir: The most important is that they decided it's neither a sea nor a lake.

Donald: Yeah, mostly gas and oil.

I think it might be my new favourite club in town. The DJ is awesome.
Jamie: What do you think about doing those presentations in groups? I know, interviews, then transcriptions, then compiling material, then writing. I think we should talk to him to make like 3 presentations, so that gives us 3-4 people per team. What you talking about? LOL I was so convinced we gotta think of everything ourselves. Hahahaha that’s gonna be fun, we kinda have parity right? Ladies first, I give you right to choose first. Just tryin to be a gentleman;). Hey, hey no name calling here! Ladies read it.

Right, I haven't thought about it. Yeah. But can you send me the link to the store? I'm considering buying the red one for myself. Denise: It is, but the green one will suit you better.

William: Are you still angry?  . Emilia: YES.
Mia: Could anybody help me to buy a flight ticket? I don't have a credit card at the moment. I've always used Peter's card, but now you know. . . I'd prefer not to. Should I send you the link?

I've heard that Jim is planning to celebrate his birthday. Yeah, normally that would make the next weekend a good time but he is going for a skiing trip with his family. So he said that he might organize something this weekend. Nothing super fancy - most likely a meetup with a few friends at some bar. Would you like to come? Most likely because it is not a real party. When I see him I'll let him know. Yeah, facebook does that to people. Yeah, see you then! . Bob: Not much, watching the game. You? Yeah, true that. Most likely the usual - run some errands, cook some food, go out for a few beers. Nothing super interesting have appeared yet. Oh right, his birthday is like next Wednesday? Sure, that would be nice. But he has not invited me, so I don't want to be rude. That would be cool - I actually haven't seen him in person for a while now. Ok, take care and see you on weekend!

Clara: Did you notice that weird smell at Kasia's place last night? I think it was her 21 cats roaming around lol. So what? They can still smell. Lol you're bad. In all honesty I don't know what it was. Ron: YES! ! ! ! ! ! I didn't want to say anything about it, though. I didn't want to be rude. Lol don't say that, those cats were cute. I think it was her sleazy boyfriend. Jk. I guess we'll never know.

Claire: Check this out )). <file_other> I guess so. But it could be a bit darker, cause this color is not very vivid. Yes, the price appeals to me xD. Ok, if you say so ). Maria: ! ! And it's no that expensive )). Don't hesitate, it's incredibly beauty! ! Nicole: Absolutely perfect for you! ! Noooooo, I think this color is perfectly good for the bride.

Abby: Have you talked to Miro? Yes, he's so interesting. Told me the story of his father coming from Albania to the US in the early 1990s. He is, he speaks only Albanian with his parents. From the seacoast. Duress I believe, he told me they are not from Tirana. That they left kind of illegally. It was a big mess and extreme poverty everywhere. Then suddenly the border was open and they just left. People were boarding available ships, whatever, just to get out of there. He showed me some pictures, like <file_photo> Yes, and his father was among the people. Very! . Dylan: No, not really, I've never had an opportunity. Really, I had no idea he is Albanian. Fascinating, where does he come from in Albania? What else did he tell you? Insane. Scary but interesting. Brandon: Me neither, but he seems a nice guy. Brenda: You met him yesterday at the party?
Julie: Hey guys. . . Could you just talk to me for a bit? I just watched this Japanese horror movie and I'm home alone and a little uneasy (aka scared shitless). Cause I'm a fucking moron? That's what I thought too! <file_other> It's scarier than it looks. I know that now. Omg really? Omg Thank you so much, I love you! Let's have a spontaneous sleepover. Yay . Rose: Jesus, why on earth would you watch a Japanese horror, home alone at this hour? Cause you're a fuckin moron. Seems pretty generic. You know that japanese horror are the worst ones, right? I wish I lived in your neighborhood. Oh, man it's late, but why the hell not. I'll bring cookies for the cocoa. Paula: 5 point for Gryffindor, my friend. But in your defense, I always thought you were quite unaffected by horror movies. So what kinda movie was it? If. . . You want me to come over I can. Yeah, sure, it's like 20 minutes by bike to your house, we can drink cocoa and watch "when harry met Sally" until we fall asleep ;). We can chip in for an Uber for you.
Lucy: 15. My little girl is 15. What should I do now? Where is the rule book? Pat, as a mother I'm not as good as I always wanted to be. . . Are you numb to all emotions? How did you feel when Patrick turned 15?  . Patricia: Why? It's like yesterday she was 5 years old. . . You know, you have like 15 years of preparation and it shouldn't come as a surprise. Don't exaggerate. . . I just don't see things as you do.

Linda: Hi Helen, was Jamie at school today? I'm afraid so High fever and a terible cough. How did you get rid of it? That's rare in these days - sometimes I think all doctors do is prescribe antibiotics. The one next to the mall? Thanks! Anyway, I just wanted to ask if there was any importans news concerning the school trip. What, why? Oh no . Helen: Yes, he was, but I've heard that Jack is sick again? Poor baby. Jamie had it all the time last year. I have this wonderful perdiatrician, doctor Tornez, he is great with kids and treats every case individually. I know! But doctor Torez i quite different. You can find him at the City Medical Centre. Exactly. You haven't heard? It's off! Half of the class is sick. . .
Tim: Seen mum 2day? Oh yeah i forgot. Nothing important. Ok for now. Louise: Nope. She's with autn Grace. Why u need her. Ciao.
Caroline: I think his mother doesn't like me. . . ;-( (. I just see it in her eyes. . . I just feel it. . . Hard to give any example. I'm his first gf and she's jelous. . . 26 but he's a nerd. He used to spend all the time at home. . Yeah. . Mummy and gramma. He's an introvert. . . It's a big house. . Nope. . . He's just a nerd, but v. intelligent! W8 , he's writing sth, will text u l8er. Kate: How come? ? Any example? What? ? ? U r his first gf? ? How old is he? ? ? O_O ? ? ? So he lives at home with mummy? ? LOL. Fuck, really? ? And u think he's normal? But has he ever lived somewhere else? U know shared flat, erasmus? He's really weird. . Ok.
Vincent: <file_photo> I broke it xD. With my bare hand. Hahaha. XD No. I was playing with my cat with a ribbon. And while raising my hand I just hit the lamp and the glass cover broke. Yeah. Should be ready to pick up on Tuesday xD. Damian: What happened to your lamp? You didn't do this just to show off did you? Shit happens. You ordered new one yet?
Nestor: I'm thinking of buying a new laptop. And it seems that now is a perfect time for it as Black Friday is coming. I haven't said anything funny, what's wrong with you. Why, cuz I want to save some money buying what I need when it's cheaper? Do you actually know what Blak Friday is about? You're just repeating a stupid theory some people made up and try to convince others that it's based on facts. And how do I know whether it's a reliable source or not? What if the laptop I want has been really cheaper and I'll miss a perfect deal? So ask him to send the offer of what he has in stock to me first. If he can offer me a good deal, I'm going to the mall and starting investigation tomorrow. Deal? We'll see about that. Olaf: Hahaha. Everything's fine with me, you're just being silly. Of course I know. It's a cunningly contrived sales pitch. Prices are thought to be reduced but in fact they're the same or even higher. . . You're really naive. . . <file_other> Click on this link and see for yourself. This is one of the sites where people upload photos of the same product and its price 2 weeks before Black Friday and during the promotion. Carry out your own investigation. Go and check prices of the chosen products when the promotion is still on and check them again when the promotion is over. Simple. Then I'll help you. I know a dude who sells almost new computers at very reasonable prices. Deal! I'll call or text him and ask to contact you. I'm sure he'll help you and you'll appreciate my advice ).
Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;). Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion? How about u, Vic? So no one uses 4 example Instagram? But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram. What do u think about Tumblr? It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u! I have my reasons ;). Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not. Probably so. Not sure, though. Well, it's intended in a completely different way. IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u. 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook. Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. So, what else? And does this motivate u to train? What? Don't have that much time to write a blog. Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;). Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook. What do u mean? Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters. I do. That's not all ppl post on Instagram! Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts. No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. Heard about it, but never had an account. Me neither.
Amanda: Have you seen the guy with dreads? I'm not convinced. Peter: Yes, so awkward! Dan: Hahaha, very, but cool!
Sue: Can you pick the car up after work tomorrow please. Yes I will transfer the money in. James: Yes and pay? Ok x.

Dima: Hello! I'm in a huge trouble, my laptop is broken and I have to deliver a translation tomorrow @9 ace_screaming_in_fear face_screaming_in. The stupid cat spilled coffee on it ersevering_face persevering. You still have your old laptop? Is it possible to lend it to me please? Ooh man! Thank you sooo much! ! ! If it weren't for Trados, I wouldn't be panicking. I know! But I always change my mind and spend the money elsewhere lol. Yup, true ! Can I come in an hour to pick it up? Nada: Hey girl, what's up? Fuck what happened? ? No sorry, I've given it to my brother - but you're lucky! I've taken these two days off so you can take mine. No worries, it happened. . . But I always think about this. . . Like man, we need some back up laptops! Yeah, but it's like our only tool! So we need to invest in it. Yes ttyl! . Fear:  Face: I'm freaking out!
Betty: So where did you go after? Anyone i know. Tell me! ! ! ! ! Ohc'mon! ! Oh no! ! ! Damned bastard. Tell me everything. Was he with someone? . .  Thanks, babes, youre the best, youre my bestie. Kelly: We wander around and met more people from school. Well, yeah. Guess. . . Guess who could pass THE pub at 2 am. . . ? Oh yes! ! ! Haha but we didnt talk almost, just hi-hi hows it goin. He looked nice, standard. Yes. . . . I'm sorry sweetie, i told him a few words, he heard from me a bit. Bastard. Not at all love, he is such an ass! .
Anne: Hi darling, do you went to come for Easter? It's could be nice, i'll invite Louise too. Thanks darling. . Adele: Love to, i'm off on friday. Great, i'll bring you eggs, chocolat ones of course!
Melody: Did you get your computer fixed yet? Do they know whats wrong with it? Thats pretty serious. Might be cheaper just to buy a new one. If you need to get a new one, i highly recommend the mac model that i have. Youre probably due for a new one anyway, no? Yes, thats ancient by laptop standards. Sounds like a good idea. Peggy: No, im spending a lot of time using the library computers. Might be something with the circuit board. They hope to have an answer tomorrow. Thats true. Well see. Ok, good to know. I'll write if i have any questions. You're right. 5 years is a long time to own one. Ok. I might just not bother getting it repaired after all.
Jerry: Hi sweetie. I'm coming home. I should be there in 40 minutes. How was your day? I know, she can be a bitch. See you later darling. Janet: Hi sugar ;). Can't wait ;). Ok, I'm waiting for you. Oh, it was ok but my boss is a pain in the ass sometimes. Yes she can! ;). 
Mark: So, we've got our where and when. Package tour or self-organised? Actually, not a bad idea. That'll be both cheap and convenient. SLAP. Let's do this asap! . Anna: Package. More convenient. I'm in! Sure. XOXOXOX. George: Self-organised. Cheaper. So, let's start digging and we'll talk about it l8r? Ur right! Julia: Do we need a 5* hotel? MAybe let's choose one of the cheaper options from a tour operator? Ok. But maybe let's divide ourselves so that we don't check the same websites?
Stanley: I can’t believe in her…. Del, she’s behaving kind of… stupid. I told her I can’t go for this weekend with her because of work. She was angry and wouldn’t listen to me. She accused me of having an affair o. O. I know, it’s crazy. I starting to give up. No, I’ll talk to her when she’s back, I’ll tell her it can’t be like this, see what will she say. Actually, me too. But at least I’ll try. Yes I’m finishing the analysis for the pervious one, but it should be done tonight, so I can start working on it today. Whaaat. Great. So division of the tasks is on me? We’ll do, it’ll be ready tomorrow, not sure what time. Btw, it’s weird that Alison is out of touch. Women…. Bill: What is it? And who? Meaning? And? How did she react? You’ve been together for like 4 moths and she’s already doing sth like that? ? ? So what, that’s it? Sorry to say that, I don’t think you’ll bring any good news xD. Well, I’m sorry. We need to take care of the Lidem project right now. The problem is I don’t what you should do ;p. The analysis of tasks is not done yet, Alison disappeared from all the media and won’t answer her phone. Yes because I’m already researching when it comes to the funding. OK, keep me posted. No at all, it’s not the first time.
Kimberly: Hi Laura. Do u remember if I left the cafe yesterday with my umbrella? Yes, with a flower motive. I got it as a present from my Mom a few years back. It's not worth anything, but it's about the sentimental value. Thanks! It's worth a try . Laura: Hey Kim. I'm not sure. . . I remember you arriving with it. It was a pinkish-blue one, right? I understand, maybe try calling the cafe? Maybe a customer found it or a waiter? Here's the. Number: 613-785-4329.
Catherine: Hi Jake, last week I applied for an accounting position @ Pandora. R u still working there? Time flies. So I take it ur satisfied? Does the company offer possibilities of personal development & promotion? I mean is there a clear career path? That's good to hear. Most companies 2day are implementing cost saving policies & the employees are the ones who suffer. I mean at my current workplace u can only count on inflation salary increases. So u barely see the difference on ur paycheck. And how about the benefits u mentioned? That sounds like a dream Your HR dept. Gave me a call yesterday and invited me to an interview on Monday. Thanks Jake Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview? OK, I'll definitely take a look. That's true. I'm a bit nervous though. Thanks. TTYS! . Jake: Hey Cathy! Really? That's great! I sure am. It's already been 5 yrs. I am, I rarely think about changing companies. Yup, that's the main pro of this place & the benefits. I was promoted twice during these 5 yrs & the salary increase with each promotion is quite significant. That's what I hear from most of my friends. It's a tough time 4 employees on the market nowadays. 4 now our company is still dynamically expanding. The company partially finances language & accounting courses. There's also a yearly bonus that depends on your achievements and private healthcare. That's great! I'll keep my fingers crossed. Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company. You can find them on the official website, in the "about us". And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u. I remember u graduated with honours from uni. There's no need to be. Give me a call after the interview. Good luck! Section:  <file_other>
Fiona: Hey. Can you go with me to a doc? I need support. Thank you so much. It's tomorrow at 8 a. m. . Anna: Hello. Yeah sure.

Matt: I feel like my homestay parents don't treat me that well. They take Carlos for subway. And I feel like they prefer talking to Carlos. Yea I guess. I don't know. It feels like a negative vibe. Is it because I stay at home too much. And so They have to pay more for electricity. True. Jorge: Why u think so? Do they feed you well tho. Maybe you're just overthinking. I doubt it but hmm. I would give a fuck. You're there one more month and go.
Ann: Hello Katie, thank you so much for hosting Tim monday evening and for dropping him at the railway station next morning. Here is mobile number. . . . I'll confirm you , but again and in.

Hi Katie, is it still ok for hosting my son tomorrow? You may send him a text to tell him where you want to pick him up. Thanks so much. Thanks. Funny you also know Stef and Leo, friends of us in Berlin. But it's true they lived in Reims before. Advance: Thanks a lot.

Sharon: My mum knows. She’s angry, I’m grounded. But I still live with my parents, let me remind you -_-. It’s not that easy, hello. I’d have to go to work, I’m still a student. My parents will stop talking to me at all. I care about my parents, cmon! Don’t talk about them like that! ! They’re just… old and manipulated. Ok, I know you fell hurt by their behavior but stop it. I do! But my family is important to me, you should understand that. Ahmed: Aaaand? For fuck’s sake you’re 19. So move out. Move in with me, we would be together all the time. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you. So what. But they’re stupid. How can you manipulated into being an asshole -_-. You don’t care about me. OK, whatever.
Rob: <file_photo> Not sure if I'm getting dumber, or this is how it feels like to get older. I'm looking at today's memes and they mostly refer to things that are either completely stupid, or have no humour value. Ehh. Fuck you. . Tom: What? Rob, get yourself a girlfriend please. You're talking bullshit.
Grace: The hand sanitizer by the restrooms is empty. Do we have a refill/. Thx. . Mike: Yes, no problem. I'll get to it right away.

No, not only… Ya know, wouldn’t be that bad, but I got angry, started screaming and everything ;/. I knoooow . I suppose yea, she kicked me out xd. I mean I don’t have to move right now, but she gave me time till the end of the year. Naah, don’t be, I believe it’s for good. I couldn’t stand her anyway xD.
Victor: Do you need me to pick you up from the airport. What time are you landing. SEVILLA? ? ? No its ok. David: That would be neat. 17 0 at Sevilla. Yeah sorry. Jerez was too expensive. You don't have to pick me up if you can't.
Ann: Hi, is the laptop still available? I can pay 200 dollars. Do you have a bag for it? Some other accessories? Sounds good, I'll take it, where can I pick it up? . Josh: Yes it is. The price is 250 and it's non-negotiable. I have a bag and a small usb mouse.
Mike: Can anybody do the washing up? I did it last time. So now its your turn. Ok. Sara: I'll do it. But when I get back. From the cinema. With Jack. Not this time )). XDD. Sam: You're going to the cinema? ? With whom? ? Ahhhh. I thought that maybe I'll join you. <file_gif>
Gary: Remember i told you i wanted to drive for uber? And how you told me it was a terrible idea. Well, i'm driving for uber D. No! I love it. I'm actually parked waiting for a ping for my next ride. It's so much fun! ! ! I've met loads of cool people! D. Why is that? What do you mean? ? ? Lol i didn't know i was perceived that way. Whatever, I'm having so much fun. Ellie: Yes. . . . D. Yes, I do remember lol. Really? ? ? Hahahhai'm sure i was right. I'm sure you hate it. Really? I would have NEVER expected YOU would enjoy it. You're. . . "peculiar" when you meet new people, lol.

Sue: Call me when you get this. It's important. Steve: OK, I'm calling.
Andre: I just read the news about the bear attack on the zoo (. Yikes - i would've never had imagine something like that could happen. Megan: That's why I always say you can't keep animals y cages! ! ! It's cruel and it's wrong! ! ! I'm not surprised the bear reacted that way.
Mick: I didn't get the confirmation emai from AES yet. You did? I gotta call them. Barbara: I did. Yes.
Alan: Can you send me the file with budget estimation. Sorry, not this one, estimation for current year, not for next year. Thanks. Tell me, do you know, why we doubled the costs in the line "other expenses" compared to last year. I see, I see. . . . Allison: Done. Sorry for the mistake, sent it to you. It was when our boss had to come back from Japan for the convention.
Liam: Yo. You free now? I feel like a stroll around. You comin? Be there in 15. Nate: Yup. What's up. Sure. I'll be ready in 10. See ya. .
Duncan: Btw bro, all the best in this year's championship. Relax, last year you were just unfortunate with the gearbox. That will really service you, i know that. We cant miss watching our youngest cousin sweep away the title. Haha, i mean it, we cant miss it for the world! Cool. Go get them! Carl: Thanks bro, hope my evo 10 wont let me down this year. Yeah, but this year im using a 6 speed hydrolic shift gearbox. Will you guys attend? Haha, stop exaggerating. Thanks, ill have you reserved in the VIp. Thanks. I will.
Dinny: Can you take your dog away before i come? A little. Terry: Are you afraid? Ok than.
Anastasia: Our new school photos. <file_photo> Look how happy I am. Ahahaha. That's my mood everywhere I step in. Well. They took the photo in less than a minute actually. Yeah. School photos always suck. They take them so fast and carelessly. Well, I needed a new one for my school ID. So I had no choice here. Ah no, I'm not worried, I actually find it kind of funny, it's fine. Darrell: You don't look unhappy to me but it's like you're, uh. What was the word. Sceptical of something. "what am I doing here". Hahaha. Oh wow. . . Well, I guess there were a lot of people? They would only really take group photos of us in middle and high school. If someone wanted a portrait photo, I guess it was possible. But not obligatory. Luckily no one really has to look at your school ID most of the time, haha. Don't worry about it.
Kim: I'm going to Seoul! People on a plane will kill me if I do. I'm going in April. Yes, of course - she'll be our tour guide. Really? I asked you like a hundred times. Agatha: Wow finally! Are you going with Jane? Mark: When? Bring us some kimchi! So jealous. . . I'd love to come as well.
Aubrianna: My friend's dad died because of malaria in kongo. So read about this. Darien: It's dangerous for all people not just whites.
Josh:  Man, I’m really pissed off. I lost my brand new sneakers somewhere. I don’t know exactly, last Tuesday I think. Many places, swimming pool and fitness, but I thought I left them in the gym. Yeah, I did call them, but they said nothing was found when they’re closing. Dunno, will try to check the swimming pool. I will. Take care, bro. Mark: What’s up, bro? Oh, man, that sucks, when? Where’ve you been to? You should call them or go there. So what are the options now? Ok, good luck. Gimme a call. You too, man. .
Bella: It's valentine's day! Eaming_face_with_smiling_eyes beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes beaming_face_with_smiling. There are a lot of vendors selling roses on the street here. <file_photo> Hahahahahahaha! ! That looks SO SAD! ‑( ‑( ‑(. Here? It's 3 degree today. Wow! Even coffee shops are all decorated with all the heart-shaped balloons. <file_photo> Only shops seems to get money. Maybe I will order some pizza home. (Sounds not that fun. Right? ) When will you come to Warsaw? This year I will probably go to Korea to get regular checkup. Make bf asap and visit us together. Quinting_face_with_tongue squinting_face_with_tongue squinting_face_with. Eyes:  Aria: For somebody without bf today is kinda miserable day. . . . . Rying_face crying. <file_gif> I feel like the weather is colder than it really is. How's the weather there? Here everywhere just chocolate. / /Of course it isn't related to me at all. / /. What's your plan? As soon as I quit, I will fly to you. Xpressionless_face expressionless. Good. Take care there. I gotta go. Ttyl. Face:  For now what I only hope is to leave work at 6. | | | |. Tongue: You too!

Viola: I think as one's feeling before the wedding - a little bit light in the stomach! Ive got some things to organize still! Thanks darling, i will let you know x. (Y) .
Madeline: I'm really not happy with Martin’s requests, and Jada's way of dealing with his problems. But it's her responsibility. I probably shouldn't care, should I? We had a little argument today, didn't you hear? Oh, ok. That's probably better ace_with_tears_of. Are we going for a beer after? Good, have a good night. See you tomorrow. More than 8 hours. Excited? Alex: What happened? No, I think I was away or oblivious. Tomorrow u need to tell me what happened lol. Sure! I can’t contain myself…. Joy: 
Mom: Hi, Betty, how are you? Me too. You could call Grandpa from time to time, you know. He's always asking about you. We're all busy. You don't have to talk long, just check in. Betty: Hi, everything's fine and you? I know, Mom, it's just I've been so busy. OK, I will. ;*.
Whitney: What will be for dinner? What's this vongole? Never seen this word. What does it mean? Oho, ambitious, how are you going to do that? Quite obvious, this is spagghetti alla vontale. Gonna get drunk ). Sounds delicious, I am mouth watering! . William: Spaghetti alla vongole. It's in Italian. Clams, it's a kind of seashells, seafood. First I will cook pasta. Alla vongole. Afterwards I make garlic golden, add wine and then clams. Very funny. I wait as clams open, and I'll add pasta.
Maria: Who's gonna be at IMF lecture tomorrow? We can discuss all remaining questions after and do the calculations? Alexander: I don't attend that class, but it is fine by me to meet. On Saturday I already have to meet for another presentation, so my option is Friday afternoon or tomorrow. It is fine by me. Sarah: I will not be there, sorry. I am working. Tomorrow and on Friday I am available from 5pm, during the weekend for the whole day. So can we meet tomorrow evening? 17 5? Martha: So when? We are due on Monday. That doesn't leave many options. Lawrence: I am meet after class anytime or make time over the weekend if needed. I will be late, but you can start without me.
Molly: Listen I've got a free ticket to the Muse concert in Cracow, want to come with me? What about you Anna. Hannah: Nah, I don't like them. Anna: Yassss please. Let's go! .
Laura: Hi Tabs, how are you doing? Oh, I'm ok, passed all exams but one. But that one was not so important. Are you coming to Daisy's party on Saturday? Ok. . . I understand that. Good! That's my girl! . Tabby: I'm ok, the only problem is I have 2 exams next week. What about you? Ok. I must see how much progress I make with studying over the next couple of days. Yeah! But I'm optimistic.
Joel: Hey, how are you guys doing? How's Coco? No way pics or didn't happen! Haha! It took you guys 2 days to win her over. She's usually not that easy. Maybe. . . Oh, man, I'm jealous ;) Is she behaving ok? You can just hiss at her or clap and she should stop. And if she wakes you in the morning you can just lock her out of the room until feeding time. I'm pretty sure it's coming. I'm glad. Just let me know if you need anything ok? Becky: She's actually sitting on my lap purring right now. <file_photo> She's a total gem. Absolutely adorable. She hasn't done that yet actually. Ok sure. Trent: Confirmed. Maybe she remembers us visiting you? Tbh she does try to scratch the couch from time to time. Yeah, we do that like you said and it works. So far she's been really sweet.
Sosie: What's your flat apartment number again? Thanks! Will be there in 5 mins. Kyra: 187. Kevin: Hurry up! We're all waiting .
Clint: I'm curious. How's the waste management working out over there? Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc. ? Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here. People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow. Really bizarre. I noticed it's struggling here. On the other hand, it's money. Reducing waste=lower utilization costs. Do they sort through everything further down? It seems to be the same way here. Dry recyclables, food and general, compost . Ronnie: It actually works very well. We use three different. Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants. Never. . . Clint What do you mean? I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that. That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong! Money in the sense of? Yes here they do. Bins: Compost, recycle and trash. Compost anything organic from yard waste to food scraps. Recycle for paper, bottles, cardboard, plastic, metals. And trash everything else. Why do you ask?
Adam: It was me who called u. Call me back or text me when u can. I see, u can call me once you're back home, I won't be sleeping until late. But don't do it before 9! Tina: Sorry, I'm still at work. . So many pple today. Dunno what time I can leave and actually my phone is dying. . . Ok, and if it's really late then I'll call u 2morrow. Sure thing.
Sally: Hi guys have you heard about Natalie? Come on! I'm sure you're all curious. Relax Jane, what's your problem? !  omb bomb. Guess who's the father! ! ! Dave! ! ! Tom: No. What about her? I am. Jane: You're such a gossip girl, Sally! She told us in confidence, I don't think we should share it with others. Greg: Now I'm also curious. That's insane! . Henriette: Tell us! Is she pregnant? I knew it! Is it Mike? WHAT? ? ? ? Bomb: 
Steve: Can you byt me some lunch? Anything but chicken. Nick: Sure, what do you want? Gotcha.
Timmy: Who do u wanna invite? Not sure about the date, but I'll be there who else? Still thinking ur getting invites to their weddings? Sure it is ;) just don't wanna admit it ;). There we go was it so hard? And u think u can change their minds? Gemma: Well, there's u and ur date. I was thinking about Lona and Michelle. It's not like that. Fine! I want to come to their wedding receptions! Yes. Dunno. .
Millie: Heeey I’m sick I won’t come today.  Sal: I’m sorry! Get better soon.
Daisy: Going home? Please be back before 11 pm. Lisa: Not yet. Ok.
Sophie: The bus is leaving in 3 minutes, are you coming? ? ? FASTER! Tina: Almost there, i am already dressed. Chill, I will make it.
Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day. . . Are you still interested? Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time. Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool. OK. Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages! Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much. He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of "family care" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own. That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque. No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings. We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him. You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me. Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat! Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am. Thank you. That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling. We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall? It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap. Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince? Well we don't see that much of them either They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony. I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you? The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment! Oh dear! What could it mean? I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else. He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all. They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright? Thank you for the quince! .
Harry: Going to Ikea, need anything? Perfect XD. Ok, got it. Will do my best. Thanks! Stay online, I may need your help. <file_photo> Is this table cloth ok? Or that one? <file_photo> Sarah: Oh yes! So could you please buy for. If you happen to go the food section, I wouldn't mind a Daim's frozen cake and a bag of meatballs ;). You can use my Ikea Family card, just give them the number and my last name and tell them you forgot to bring it ;) 17927192. First one's perfect ;). Me: White table cloth 120 cm x 140 cm, as simple as it gets, two medium size wardrobe organisers (the ones with grey flowers), one wooden spatula and three bottle cleaners.
Cindy: <file_gif> I don’t want to talk about it…. <file_video> Have you seen it? It’s viral on the internet. Ellie: Why are you so sad? Something’s happened? Cheer up! Tomorrow’s another day miling_face_with_smiling. Nope, but it’s very funny miling_face_with_smiling. <file_gif> Eyes:  
Nadia: Heeeeey how are you? Cool, we just woke up like 20min ago and will eat something too. Of course we had, I hope we will repeat it soon. Hahahah yeah it was. But it was really cool, I'm still in a very dancing mood. Sounds cool ;). Jannet: Hey, I'm cool, we just got up and now we're doing some breakfast how are you guys? Nice thank you guys for coming yesterday, it was really nice to have you here, I hope you had fun. Sure, we just have to wait for the neighbours to forget about us, cause it was fuckin loud yesterday xD. Perfect, the next time we're going to the disco then.
Mark: Have you seen his new car? ! ! No fucking clue, but the ride is legit. Over my dead body I gotta be first one to try it out. Wanna bet he'll let me first ? Hahaha deal! . Jeff: Dude, wtf, it's like insane. How the hell did he afford it? ? ? Hell yeah, I'd drive this baby. Yeah, you wish. 100 bucks dude, I'll bet your ass.
Ann: Congratulations! ! You did great, both of you! Let's have a little celebration tonight! Sue: Thanks, Ann. I'm in. Julie: I'm glad it's over! That's co cute of you, girl! Me too! ! ! Aww.
Kathy: <file_picture> Aunt on the chair getting her haircut today. I think I'm also going to get something done today. Maybe get it cut a bit shorter. <file_picture> : <file_picture> The end results. Thanks! . Olivia: Ooo how fun! I am just chillin today. <file_picture> Very cute! <file_gif> Although not a big difference with Aunt's hair. But yours looks really nice!
Benson: Hello everyone. First of all, thank you for staying after hours. As you know, I'm currently in Peru discussing a contract with a new client. Mr. We need to discuss a couple of. No, Mark, we're just starting. . Matters: Your work while I'm gone and things I need from you asap. Claudia: Hello, Mr. Benson. Of course. What do you require from us? Andy: Hello, Mr. Benson. I'm here. Mark: Hello, so am I. Sorry for being a little late. Had a call with a client. Did I miss anything? Mr.
Jane: Your mums losing it. She just text me about crying over this morning? No the telly program with phil and holly. Some baby reveal ace_with_tears_of. I think she needs to get out of the house. Thats a good idea x. Den: Why you say that? What did she do this morning? Oh right y? I'm confused. Invite her for tea on Friday I'll bring fish and chips home after work. Joy:  More: 
Ludo: Hi mum, did you arrive at school? And do you know my class number? Good, so cool. Ok no problem. Yes i saw. Ok thanks. Mum: Yes , i'm in front of the. Yes class 3, as Hugo and Charles. I'll show you the picture of the listing, but i couldn't manage to see the room. The building is quite big and there is also a huge garden, you'll have room enough. I have to go, meeting is starting. Don't wait for me. Door: You're room 112 with Hugo and Charles.
Chandler: Phoebe! ! Do you have money? ? Open your door. . And pay the delivery guy standing outside my door. . Phoebe: Yes I have . . But why do you need it. . Oh chandler ! ! You idiot. . . On my way. . .
Rory: Max, is your sister studying in China? How does she like it? Does she speak Chinese? True, I don't think you could stay unemployed speaking Chinese. True. Anyway, where is is? Beijing? I've just checked, it has 25 million inhabitants! Insane, it's the population of the whole Australia. Max: She is. It's not amazing, but she believes it's a good investment. I think she does already. Hahaha. Really? But there are Chinese everywhere and they speak foreign languages. Nope. Shanghai. Yes, she said it's actually bigger than the capital. Joseph: Hard to control I imagine. Eliza: I think this is the best investment imaginable. Sure, the every 5th earthling is Chinese. Or so.
David: Morning Russ. Have you seen the report I emailed yesterday? Is there anything you'd like me to do right now? Sounds good. I guess I'll just answer some emails. Russ: Hi David. Well received thank you. But I haven't read it yet. I'll take a look at the report in a moment and will send you remarks if I have any. Please do. I should be done by midday with the report. .
Catherine: We're going to visit uncle Steve, want to come with us? He's family and we haven't seen him in a long time. Come on, even you can do it from time to time. The boys want to see you. You know that he'll be disappointed? Yes. Maybe that's his way of showing that he cares about you. Depends on the day. Today I'm tired so I can't guarantee it. Alright, don't worry, I'll stop. But still the part about the boys missing you was true. So come and visit them when you'll have the chance. Ben: Why would I? You know very well that I'm not fond of such visits. They stress me out. Maybe I can but I don't want to. It will end the same way as usual. With me being pissed at everyone. I can visit you and play with them some other day. I don't have to drive to another city to do it. Uncle Steve? I don't think so, we don't have anything in common. All he ever does is bothering me with stupid questions about my private life. Yes. . . Sure. . . Sometimes I wonder if you're thinking about what you type. You should rest then. Instead of asking me to do stuff I don't like. I will.
Kaya: We have been looking for you in Library. Be right there. Clay: I am the class room.
Sean: Hey, I won't be able to take the car to the carwash. They want me to finish report first. <file_gif> We can leave a bit earlier or get it washed somewhere on the road. Great! . Alice: Shoot, but it's crazily dirty. Will we have tomorrow? It might be good idea, let's do it tomorrow then.
Julia: Hey, what time are you getting home? I was wondering if we should wait for you with the dinner? Ok. Call me if you're running late. Bert: 8-ish. Why? Yeah, that would be nice of you. I'll try to get there on time. I will. Xx.
Steve: Hiya the dishwasher has turned up. Yes they did a good job. <file_photo> Yes it does its nice and quiet. I think so, not that I ever have 12 for dinner lol. No every other. I am thanks mum xxx. Mum: Good did they install it for you. Looks really nice. Is it a 12 place setting one? Not but you dont have to put it on every day. Yes I'm glad you are pleased with it xx.
Harvey: Update? That is an update, Michelle. I can't wait all day. Fair point. Why not? Oh, right. Thanks. . Michelle: Too soon, still researching. Fine. If you stop texting me, I could get on with it! Besides, half of this stuff is black hat. I can't see most of it. It installs bugs on my computer. It's fine. I'm back on it.
Bill: Lovely pie. I really miss you. When are you coming back. Cant wait to see you. Joy: Hey lover boy. I miss you too ace_blowing_a. On thursday. Me too. Kiss: 
Henry: Do you know what happened to cafe Kohaku? Yeah. I wanted to reserve a table, but I can't find them anywhere. Their Facebook page disappeared. For good? ! Oh no, I loved that place. Unless they do it far away, the location was perfect. It was a real gem in this touristy district. Eh, that's a pity then, I was so looking forward to their brownie. How was the Lilly's? Uhm, don't think so. It's always awfully crowded and there are more tourists than normal people like us. Julia: The one near Covent Garden? I'm afraid they're closed. Afraid so. I've been there last week and wanted to take my cousin there, but the place's empty. Probably the rent was too high. Me too. I checked online for the owners and contacted them, but they haven't replied yet. I hope they will reopen somewhere else. I know, I know. . . We went the Lilly's in the end, my cousin and I, but it's not the same. It's all right, it's a different vibe though. I think you should go to the Japan Centre for the same.
Jake: What are your plans for the day? Like what? Tax filing is a long way off. Anything else? Already ready or you still need to do post-production? I do, but I dont always have time to do much. Yeah. And some of those claims are purely speculative. One time I put on one of my own pieces and it was challenged by Sony Music. It's true. On the form you fill in to counter the claim I said if Sony want to make me one of their signed artists, that's fine. Otherwise to get they paws off of my music. . Olivia: I haven't really got anything planned. There are some things I should do which I haven't looked at for a while. I ought to do my accounts. At least get all the incoming and outgoing invoices sorted by months. I know, but doing it all at the last minute is a dreadful headache. I also have a few videos I need to upload to YouTube. I don't really do much by way of post-production. I'm not exactly Steven Spielberg. If I put in any music I always get a copyright strike and someone else is taking the ad revenue. No way!
Emily: Oh Linda. . . Something horrible has happened. I'm so sorry. I have broken one of your green tea cups. Just looked away and brushed it off the table with my skirt. SORRY! I'm feeling so bad about it. So clumsy of me. I was cleaning the cupboards in the dining room. Exactly. I thought they're so pretty, especially the green ones, and then noticed how dusty they are. So I thought I'd be a helpful guest and wash them. I did. And then I made myself a cuppa in the green one. And it happened. Ya. Smashing. As we say in GB. But Linda! I'm speechless. CU. And THANK YOU. Linda: No worries babe! It's nothing. Really. Look. I never really liked the set, so one cup makes no difference. I hardly use it anyway. How come it was on the table BTW? You did what? Whatever for? The crockery there is more for decoration. Ya golden! Really! Look, calm down. You are a fantastic guest. You know what? Take out the whole green set. If you like it so much - it is yours. Precious! See you in the evening!
Tom: Have you ever been to Dublin? So let's go there this weekend! Yes, the weather forecast is great! Ok, so I'm buying the tickets. Camilla: Never in Ireland! For 2 days? I love your crazy ideas! 
Stella: Hi Sandra. Did you recover finally? I wanted to come and visit you but I didn't want to get infected by the disease that you've been carrying. You know. . . I'm a teacher, I could spread the disease. It's very nice to here that, I'm so happy for you! Hope you'll be in a perfect health soon. I want to take you to the cinema. They have a brilliant repertoire now. I understand. Just tell me, what kind of movie would you like to watch? A romantic comedy, horror, fantasy or something else? I'll do some research in my friends' midst and try to choose the best option. You got it! I'll find something special for you. So I'm keeping my fingers crossed for your quick recovery. Talk to you soon! Sandra: Hello my dear. I'm getting better every day but there's still something left. I have some effective medicines now. All the drugs that doctors have been prescribing to me so far were useless. Now the difference in my well-being is surprisingly considerable. Oh, I dream of getting out of the house! I used to love laying in the bed for hours, but now I hate it. I'm dreaming of watching some action movie. With all the special effects and dynamic action. Something that would be the opposite of my current situation. Thanks, Stella, my darling. You made my day. Bye bye.
Harley: You should see this divorce filing. OMG. . . The guy was a serial cheater! She's taking him to the cleaners. Monthly settlement, half his pension, you name it. There are always two sides. . . Never cooked. Never cleaned. He paid for everything yet still managed to buy her mom a house and take extravagant vacays. Voice of experience, sorry! Yes, and some times theres karma, but. . . Ruby: Bad? OMG! He deserves it! Maybe she was a piss poor wife? Geez, down boy! Well, people do crazy things. You're right, two sides. .
Ken: Hi, how are you? I'm okay. . . Just stressed; work stuff, fighting with Brad, too much going on at mom's. I know, but it's a lot. You are! Listening to me vent! LOL! Show Saturday night, then seeing the grandkids on Sunday at the zoo. Gotta run, work calls. Love you! You too! . Ang: Just peachy! You? Just okay? What's wrong? Hang in there, it will get better! Can I do anything to help? Are you at least doing anything fun this weekend? Sounds great! That will cheer you up! Love you too! Have a fantastic day!

Don: Hi Cindy. Have you made all arrangements? Both, I suppose. Where did you set it up? That's good. Did everybody got the agenda? How did Andy react when he saw it? That's Andy all right. And how about the trip. Which one? Perfect ). I think, I can manage that;=). Good job, Cindy. No idea, where I'd be without you. . Cindy: It's about today's meeting or your trip next week? You have meeting with management board today at 2 pm. In our conference room. Catering will bring some tea, coffee and snacks. Yep. Can't say, really. Not sure if he even read it. I've got your plane tickets and booked the hotel. Hilton, as usual. But nobody is gonna pick you up at the airport. You'll have to get a cab.
Samuel: <photo_file> <location> Just a joint for now. But mushroom pizza also looks tempting. I guess the owner bribed the police. Virginia: Hahaha. Where are you? What did you order? Is it legal in Laos? Jack: Hilarious. I love the "happy menu". Man, it's heaven. I need to go there .
Celia: Where do you want to go for Holiday ? Too hot. What about Croatia ? Mike: I was thinking about Egypt. Good idea, I've never been there.
Jasmine: Have you heard this song? <video> It’s a new song of Charlie Puth. Love him! ! Yep! It’s awesome! It’s so British inking. Paola: He’s cute miling_face_with_smiling. I also love Galway Girl. Recently, I’ve been listening to it all the time. <video> Looooove it! ! . Eyes:  Face: 
Sharon: Hello Jaz, you busy Sunday? Do you think you could pop in and sort out my roots? I can't get to the salon this week? Oh yes! Boxes of the stuff, I buy in bulk on Amazon. 2. 30 OK for you? Jaz: No, not really, you need something done? Sure, you got the right colour dye there? That's fine, I'll pop it in my calendar. See you Sunday. .
Ann: Are you coming home for lunch? Okay. Pete: Yes be right there. 20 min or so.
Laura: Do you think you can tidy up my dreads for me this weekend? <file_photo> <file_photo> <file_photo> They're really messy. Kas: Probably. Have to check my schedule with work first and let you know. It'll take a couple of days to sort out the mess. I'll let you know tonight if I can do it. .
Ally: How many did you do so far? How many hours? Ok, same here. Jill: Like 20 or 30. I can't do more than 3-4 per day. 40? Maybe 35. . .
James: Amelia said that one of our lecturers in philosophy had an art exhibition (! ). It opens tomorrow! I'm talking about this guy who taught us ethics. Amelia recommends it. ME TOO, of course! Can Amelia go with us? Both. Yes, I do. Are you mad at me? Babe, the fact that I suggested that we might go out with Amelia doesn't mean that I don't value time that we spend together, just the two of us. Are you sure you're fine with this?  But you know me, don't you? Really, there's nothing to worry about. Amelia is quite laid-back and likable. ;). Afterwards we can go to my place and hang out, cuddle and so on. . . So we're good, right? Mia: No way. . . ! Professor Evans and art exhibition What has happened to this world? But you know what? I would actually like to see it! To the exhibition or to the exhibition and to the cinema? You remember that we have plans for tomorrow. . . ? Ok. I know, I said ok. Yup. I just don't know her very well, it's gonna be stressful for me. Maybe I do. Sounds good. Right. ;).
Mariana: Hi, just a quick question. Do you know if the readings for the next session of Stephen’s seminar are in the print shop? Sounds familiar. Rita: No idea, sorry Chae. I’ll go tomorrow morning and let you know if the texts are available. I can’t buy the copies for you because they never have enough at hand but I’ll just ask them to print more for later Chae. Cool. Will do! Xx. Yeong: The only thing I know is that they were not yet there on Monday. No worries. Arthur: Yer, I’ve made the mistake of going on Monday as well and I can confirm the texts were not there and the staff was as rude as always. Yeah, just let us know if they’re ready, that’s a huge favour already.
Ost: I bought a garage place in the garage. I got it cheap. It's my intention to rent it out and do the restitution of my money. There is a big crowd in parking, so the prices for finding garage places are favorable, in this area. Return on investment is much higher than if I give money under term savings in the Bank. The interest rates are very small, almost close to zero, "only they do not ask you to pay them, for holding money in the Bank". Prices of garage places, in Belgrade, will only grow. Yes, there are more and more vehicles in the city center, as the number of vehicles per family is growing. It used to be about one vehicle per family, and now it's approaching an average of two vehicles. And there will not be new parking space. . Vesna: Cool. Well doneeeee! . Really! . You make sense for money. O yes. Really! . Yes. .
Julia: Where are you? Did you stop in Zawiercie already? Gosh, that's really far away. I know how you feel love, I am sick of trains already. I will be waiting! You must be starving, I am gonna make some food. What would you like? Are you sure? ? Sounds like a plan pizza or burgers? OK! And I will pick you up from the platform, let me know when you pass Żyrardów. See you ). Hania: That's a good question, haha. No idea. . . The schedule says the next station is in Poraj. Don't even tell me, I have been on the road for 3 hours already. I will be there around 7pm I guess. Great! Nah, I am so exhausted I don't even feel any hunger. Or actually maybe we will order some takeaway? Pizza always. Ok, see you soon!
Kaylee: Enough is enough, I am blocking you now -_. I am blocking you, seriously. You really don't care?  . Gavin: As if I care. Bye. Please go away you are too much irritating.
Marika: Are you coming today? Great! . Lara: Yes!
Mazie: Me and mah girls are having a drink tonight. Wouldn't you like to know. . . That's cold. OIC. . . who? You just saw her on a bad day. You did spill a drink on her.  You did! LOL. Lee: Oh really? Where? Yes! So I can stay away! True, can't stand some of your friends. Sheryl for one. She's a b-word that rhymes with witch. Don't think so! Well. . . I said sorry!
Erin: Hey Zach. Look at this babe, I've just baked it. <file_photo> Oh what are you doing then? Hardly, I need hard evidence. Zachary: Looks delicious! Pls bring me a piece of this later on. I'm pretty busy right now. I decided to clean the flat, can you imagine? Here it goes. <file_photo>
Joseph: U there, mate? Damn, I'm tired af. Had three job interviews in two days. I think the first two were more than ok, they seemed really satisfied with my résumé, heh, guess I'll have to choose one. Yeah, I guess I'm gonna be a concierge until the day I die. What's so funny about it? Right! "Well, how do you call it? ". Lol! Anyway the third interview was ok but I don't know, the woman there didn't seem to like me. Oh, sod off, mate! . Albert: Yeah. Why? Ouch! So. . . Any impressions? Were both interviews for jobs at hotels? O la la! A concierge! With his résumé! It reminded me of that Simpsons episode, you know. . . "the GARAGE? ! O la dee dah, Mr. Frenchman! ". "A carhole! " XD. NO WOMAN likes you, Joe!
Sue: Hi Graham when you have a minute can you throw me some dates over for weekends in the Romford area, that lady Louise wants another 2 half days and focus on motorways. Brilliant I will send those on. Yes she was nice she wants you to focus on motorways this time. I will let you know when she comes back to me. Graham: Yes give me an hour. Hi Sue. . I have 2/3/9/10/16/17/23/ let me know. That is good she came back. Yes we only touched on it last week. Thanks sue.
Brett: So what do u do there? Drive a tank all the time? What do u mean? Not cool. Actually, my cousin met his wife there. Yeah. They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. Turned out they lived very close to each other ;). Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ;). What's this one about? C'mon! Tell us! Sounds boring. John: Yes and no. U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. Can be a lot of fun! That's not a problem. The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u. So what's WoW like? Yeah. Y would they allow such a thing? Rly? Lol. Can u name a title, except WoW? Well, I haven't. Andrew: So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? They basically destroy u! Sensible. Unlike WoW. Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly. Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on. That's gr8! And how are they getting along now? Well my favourite genre is RPGs. I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the Final Fantasy series. Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest RPG series of all times? I think I'll have to look for new friends. . . So embarrassing. Fine. . . Usually u play a group of friends that have to resolve some kind of crisis. In the last part u play a prince whose kingdom has been destroyed and u try to well get revenge. Believe me, it's not! .
Rael: Gosh, I fucking hate my job! I'm serious, I'm done. Those people are fucked up. I cannot stand it anymore. Even worse. . . I don't even have time to eat my fucking lunch. It's not normal. Yeah, this retard doesn't get that we're humans not robots. I hate him. It's not that easy, I gotta find something. I don't want to leave without first finding a new job. No, why? Zach, are you crazy? I don't have technical studies. Hmm. . . Maybe you're right. I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so. . . Why not. That would be great, thanks. Zach: Oops! Someone is in a mood. . . Is it that bad? What this time? Did you talk to your manager? You're gonna quit? I see. Did you think about IT? Girl, it's the best place to work in! A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. Good money and no rat race. You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future. If you want, I can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on. UW. In touch. .
Jill: So how was your date anyway? Tell me everything! ! Suit on? Hahahahaha. So where did he take you? Rollerskating what? Are you serious? If you say so. . . I am not! ! ! ! ! ! ! Susan: It was perfect, he was so sweet! ! So first he picked me up from home, all dressed up and everything. Nooo, not like that, but he had a really nice black shirt, elegant shoes, looked like Brad Pitt hahaha. <file_gif> That's the best part! We went to rollerskating disco! ! ! No no, listen - it was so awesome, I am tired of all this dull restaurant dates and stuff, it was actually something original. You are just jealous Jill. Yes you are .
Joe: Yo. Wanna come over tonite? Gonna watch Deadpool 2 with the guys. Ok, I'm. Pete: Yo, sup? Cool! Count on me. Lol. Counting: 1, 2, 3. . .
Euodia: What is tiktok? I have no idea but my friends were talking about that ace_without_mouth face_without_mouth face_without. And I felt a bit ashamed of not knowing what they all knoe about. *Know. Why do they do that? Onfused_face confused. Omg I don't understand why I feel so old(;_ (;_. Domigo: You don't know what it is? o_O! Shocking! O_O. That is hit application recently( ^^). You can take some videos for yourself and edit it with music and special effects as you wish( ^. ^)( ^_^). And share it on YouTube or just with your friends. Cause it is new and interesting! (^0_0^).

Come one just kidding. We love you. Anthony: Greece is warm sunny and cheapish. What? ? Why? ? Worth a look? We have no choice XD.
Maria: Where are you? Why not Prudential? We don't have time, we were supposed to meet at Prudential. You always misunderstand. Harry up, please, I'm so tired. That you would have avoided if you had come to Prudential. So I want to enjoy it, instead of waiting for 30min in front of a mall. We will see. Lori: Copley. It's close, I can be there in 10min. Sorry, I misunderstood. There is a traffic jam. Relax, it's Friday! I'm there in 5 min.
Marta: I swear that jay is a pathological liar! ! ! ! ! ! He keeps talking about how he has all this money and travels all over the world. Well i just found out he lives in a studio apartment in the outskirts of town! ! ! ! ! ! ! (. Rose: Why do you say that? Lol yes, that's all he talks about.
Telly: What are you guys doing on New Year's? I was wondering about going to Luke's party but I'm kinda hesitant. Oh cool, I wasn't invited ,though. Oh, ok, cool. Is there a fb event? Great, I'll check it out. Let me know when you make up your mind, might help me too ;). Chuck: We're not really sure yet. I think. Ally? There's also a party at Bernie's <file_other> You know how Bernie is, all of his parties are open, it also says so in the description. You got it. Ally: Idk. . . Yeah me too. As much as I love Luke his apartment is not particularly party-friendly. We were also wondering about The Spot - they are having a New Year's party, but you have to sign up pretty quickly. <file_other>
Karen: I passed! ! ! ! ! Simon: Whooooooooooah! ! ! ! ! Tim: Congrats! ! ! Patty: Guess we have a new designated driver .
Gill: I need a new peeling. This one is not so good. It has only small pieces of seeds. And i need more power. How? I think so. Brilliant thx . Bunny: Why? You can make your own peeling. Do you have some real coffee? So make it. Drink it. Relax. And then take the seeds and pour some oil. And scrub your body.
Ryan: Merry Christmas everybody! Visiting family in Manchester. White a disaster hahhaha. Nick: Merry Xmas! Chris: Merry Xmas to you! Where are you btw? We stayed home with Ann, first time on our own! And I've liked it so far very much.
Oliver: Dude, how's the campaign going? Good! Have we reached 5000 dollars yet? Crowdfunding is the way! . Bruce: It's more than ok, we've got around 200 backers right now. Yes, we're a little over 6000. . . 6132 bucks.
Liam: Will pick you up at 8. Be ready. Just don't get us late please. Kane: Cool man.
Kate: I just had a fight with Chris. It's not me who started it. I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose. Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him. I'm angry every single time I talk with him. I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it. Right? ! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck. What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything. Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once. Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself. I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US. Yes. You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him. Mary: Oh no, not again. What was it this time? Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say? Oh god. What did you tell him? I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that. I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him. Oh my god he said that? Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much. No wonder.
Celine: <file_picture> We went on skates. No. It's his first time. Thanks to that, we have a lot of fun here. Mia: Where are you? Mark knows how to skate? I would like to be there with you.
Sarah: Are you going back home for Passover? I'll be going. I know. Same here. I bought my tickets yesterday. 500 quid. What to do. . . This year we are going to the desert. The whole family will sleep in a huge tent. Really? That's where we are going this year.  Passover is definitely my favourite holiday. On the 28th. Lia: Not sure yet, you? I don't know. My family wants me to come but the tickets are so expensive and I have so much work. How much did you pay? It's expensive. I'll see maybe my family can help me out. It would be lovely to spend holidays with them. That's great. Last year we went to Negev. It is absolutely amazing. You will love it! I wish I could go too. . . Mine too. I'll talk to my mum later. We'll see. When are you flying? Great. .
Gene: Did you get the package I sent you. On Friday. 12345678900. Jack: No, when did you send it? Shit I should have gotten it by now. Send me the tracking umber I;ll check whats up.
Miranda: Hi S, could we cancel tomorrow's meeting? I have to work. That's what young doctors do. No they come close to death but survive and it makes them immortal. Stephanie: Again? What happened? You work 20 hours a day! They kill themselves working. As long as you have an explanation .
Clara: Where should we get off? Hahahah. Blake: A place called fabro-ficule. It is a bit indeed. I will, on the platform. There's only one platform of course ;). Jenny: Must be really a shithole. Will you wait for us there?
Raymond: Charlotte! Help! What do I want to eat, pizza or pasta? So I have a regular cheese and pepperoni pizza and I was thinking some pesto pennes. That's not helpful. But pasta sounds so good. But the pizza sounds delicious too. I can't! Please help me. Well, that's just unreasonable no? That could work. That way I would eat the same amount but of the two things I want to eat. For sure. Oh, and bring wine! Charlotte: What's up bro? ? Hmm. . What kind of pizza and what kind of pasta? Oo, those both sound good. Have the pizza! Then have the pasta silly. Omg Raymond, make up your mind. Why not have both? How about this. I come over and we have both! Alright, so I'm going to head over in like 10 minutes. That sound good? Yes sir. See you in 15. .
Zack: Dude have you seen the new Jersey Shore season? Ahahah no surprise there. But yeah I watched a couple of episodes and it was hilarious. Yep. Snooki, J-Wow, Pauly D, Ron, The Situation, Deena and Vinny. Yeah and he still is. I have no idea but he is really diferent now. No dude really, he's super funny and a nice guy now. Check it out! Season 2 is almost there so we will have some more episodes to watch after we finish the first season. Ahahah do that! . Dwayne: Didn't even knew a new one came out xD. It's the original cast? I herad The Situation was having some bad legal problems. . How come he's doing the show? I highly doubt that xD. Damn it seems I have to check it out, that sounds interesting ahaha. Alright. I'm gonna start watching, I will let you know what I think afterwards.
Will: I hate ques. I'm standing in a line longer than the post office itself. In order to just send a damn letter in XXI century. Damn. The best think about my XXI century comment is that the line consists almost entirely of elderly people who don't have bank account and pay their bills via post office paying cash. Where is digitalisation when you need it? Chris: What a time to be alive. Lines are the part of everday life of any person living in a big city. There is nothing special in it, but I hope you'll think twice next time you decide to send a traditional letter. Haha. Hang on there. .
Tobi: Have you been to the new club? Yes, this one. Oh, shit. Nicholas: Cork? They need some time maybe? Serena: Waste of time. We went there with Ella last weekend. You won't believe. Ella: Yes, huge disappointment. Because they had such a cool ad campaign. It was empty. Nobody there. Yes, that's the proper word. Maybe, but I won't risk again.
Molly: Guys, do you think it's a very bad idea to go to Sweden for a week in January? We will thanks ;). Margaret: We bought some cheap tickets half a year ago and now we're hesitating. Rainy? Yes, but it's January, one would have to go to Argentina to enjoy nature. Peter: Haha, no but it will be just dark and cold. Visit the Vasa Museum, it's really fun. Enjoy! . Kai: Possibly. But if you stay in Stockholm there are always nice things to do. Museums, bars etc. Not so much nature though. Which is truly stunning around Stockholm. Exactly.
Avril: Hi! Have you got plans for the weekend? Do you like mushroom picking?  Of course not! ^^. Buti'm going to see horse racing. U comin'? Frank: Hello, no, I don't. I mean I have some things to do, but nothing special. U serious? Now, u r talking! Sure I'll come with u! .
Mel: Hi, is Adam going to Multisports, Xander really wants to go this week. Would you? The house is a complete pigsty. Work has been full-on this week, pre sales and all that! Yes, you had a nasty little bunch on your section. Most have left now, thank God! I'll bring him round at half 10, is that ok? I do appreciate this! Mair: Adam is moaning about going, but if Xand is going, he might be a bit keener. Do you want me to take them this week? Yeah, I remember that. Glad to be out of it and the bitching and bullying, of course! What are mates for! See you both tomorrow! .

Pam: Hey I lost my phone so if you need something message me here. I went shopping and when I was paying I must have left my phone on the counter. I talked to every single store I visited and nothing. Yeah, I've only had it for half a year. How? Cool! ! I have to check it out. I'll do that! ! Thanks! ! Dot: Oh now how? ? Did you come back to check if they found it? It was an iphone right? But there's an option where you can display something on the screen. You have to log into your apple account and there is an instruction. You could promise a reward and post someone's phone number. I hope you find it .
Rodney: Have you heard a guy got beaten and mugged on campus? They're gonna give an official statement about. There's also gonna be an article in the paper. As far as I know the assailant had a mask on. He's in the hospital, but it seems like he'll be fine. Who knows what those jocks are capable of. They don't give a fuck. Truman: Oh, man is he ok? And what about the beaten guy? On the other hand its easy to get on campus without being detected. If your masked it don't matter. You know how those security guards are. Hope they catch the guy soon. Ross: Do they have any idea who did it? You think it was a student? They could do it just for fun. There are cameras. True that.
Nathan: Hey Honey, what are our plans for tomorrow then? Totally true, I started packing my stuff in the bedroom, I also told the girls to start packing too. No, I explained to her that he'll be fine without her these few days, I hope it worked. I remember, Lucy was really excited about that. Are we taking the bicycles? Now you're talking! We could have a ride to this beautiful cliff where we were last year! So tomorrow I'm seeing the dentist after work, you go to pick up the girls from school…. Thanks Honey, so nice of you to remind me of this! After the quick bite you girls have, we are off! Yes, it's feasible I'll do it on my way from work. I should be home around 6, if nothing happens. Deborah: So I've been thinking that we should pack everything today, we won't have time tomorrow. If Sofie wants to take the unicorn we won't have much space in the car XD. We need to take boots and those warm jackets for the girls, my parents promised them to take them on a trip to the forest. Yeah, don't you think we could use some alone time while the rest of the family is hiking? XD. Why not, it's a wonderful idea! Yeah, then we meet at home, have a quick bite (you probably won't, haha! ). Damn, I forgot to buy this syrup for travel sickness. Will you have time today to do it? Wonderful! So see you in the evening then? Dinner will be waiting for you in the oven, bye .
Casper: Is any of you nobel fellows going for tomorrow's classes with Mr Linda? Ahahahaha. True, I saw that! That's a fancy nickname, I like it. But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus. Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense. Great, so we've reached an unanimous decision. Let's meet near the university and we'll work something out. Alexander: Hmm. . . To be or not to be, that is the question! But remembering the last lecture with Linda, my answer is like moving towards NO. I think it's not that the subjects themselves are boring, it must be his voice. I mean it's so monotonous and hypnotic. Kind of. . . Lulling you to sleep. Haha David Copperfield. Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a little. Not a bit! And learning from Igor's last experience I think we should go somewhere else instead. I don't want to end up snoring and getting embarrassed. All right! . Igor: Amen to that, Alex! Last time I came so self-motivated and full of energy that I thought I could even dominate the lecture. I sat in the second row, concentrated, even took some notes and asked two questions. After few minutes Lewis poked me and told to stop snoring. . . Yeah, that guy is like David Copperfield among lecturers. So. . . Judging from the overall tone of our discussion I feel that the decision's been already made. Am I right, gentlemen? So where are we going instead? Agreed.
Javier: Hey do you know any tattoo parlors over here with English speaking employees? The name sounds neat. . . Have you had a tattoo done there? Got a pic? Wow that looks amazing. How much did she pay? Fuck. Let me just get a tatttoo back in colombia then, thx. Judie: Oh there's Warsaw ink. Nope but my gf has. <file_photo> It was a 1000.
Sam: You own a really nice hotel, guys miling_face_with_smiling. How is our hotel room set for next month? Hope that the manager will arrange the very best for us inking. Yep!

You’re damn right, Sam. Are you coming on the 15th of August? Face: 
Marsha: Guys, we've planned the trip with John last night as we promised. But of course you have to agree on that. So as we decided last time, we will spend a week just on the beach. We all wanted some calm, nice place, right? John found this little hotel in Nosy Be. <file_photo> And their. It's quite basic the website, but it may actually be a good sign. I know. It's more expensive than hotels on the mainland. But it seems to be the most beautiful place in Madagascar. Exactly! . Cynthia: Great, thank you for that. It seems just perfect. Mohammad: Sure, but I really trust you. So let's go there, it's still cheaper than Italy for example. Gavin: Me too. Yes! ! ! I love it! Website: <file_other>
Adelina: Hi handsome. Where you you come from? What do you mean, "what do you mean"? It's a simple question, where do you come from? OK. Are you all right? OK, bye. If you're gonna be a dick. . . Cyprien: What do you mean? Well I was born in Jarrow, live in London now, so you could say I came from either of those places. I was educated in Loughborouogh, so in a sense I came from there. In another sense I come from my mother's vagina, but I dare say everyone can say that. IN another sense I come from the atoms in the air that I breath or the food I eat, which comes to me from many places, so all I can say is "I come from Planet Earth". Wait, what you got against earthlings? .
Joanna: I need to get the coffie stains out of my dress. Do you know any effective methods? It's ecru and the fabric is very soft. You might be right, just hope it won't cost me an arm and a leg. . . Alright then, I'll give it a try, thanks Ethel! . Ethel: What color is this dress? Well, in such a case I wouldn't recommend fixing it by yourself because you can ruin the dress. . . Better leave it at the dry-cleaner's. There's a cheap one at Jagiellonska 3, they cleaned up all the stains from my favourite dress.
Anna: Hi, would you like to have a pizza with us tonight? Ok, no problem, have a nice evening.  Charlie: No thanks, I don't want to appear rude, but you know I'm still upset about all the things that happened. Yeah, you too. . . Yeah, cheers.

Are you upset. Daniel: What, your money? ? Why would I. Are you calling me a liar, Terry? ? And I'm not a thief? ? That's not cool, man. Good for you then. What do you think? ? Yeah, oh-fucking-course I am.
Lucy: Have you thrown the garbage out? I guess I will have to now. Levy: I thought you were supposed to do that as per parents order.

Lindsey: Sup? I have just finished my class. I mean I should go for another class also. But earlier I asked one girl to put my name on the attendance list instead of me. Last week I did the same. I just hope that those signatures ( since last week I asked another girl) will be enough similar to mine. Because I gave them a piece of paper with my name written on it. Sage: Nothing just having a beer. You? Cool. Oh really. Hahaha. Naughty naughty! Good luck haha.
Jason: What are you doing this weekend? If you're bored maybe we should do something, but we also MUST create the video! Yay! How long will s/he be staying?

She still angryey about the party? I prefer mountains anyway. Dodson: I dont do much skiing at all. Actually, we and trish think of going to the seaside. We cant afford that. Well just go somewhere near, book a hotel for 3/4 nites. Yeah, whatever to make her happy. Slowly getting better. Yeah i wish. Not in this century.
Alex: Hi there, fancy a drink tonight? How about 8 pm? Great. See you then. . Zayna: Why not what time? Sounds good. My place?
Grace: I didn't get to talk to you a lot at the party last night. Not really, i'm excited about graduating soon. I thinki'll apply for grad school buti'm still not sure.

You can do this. I'm sure she's not. Don't mind her. No, that's ballet slipper, not pink. Sure. .
Mike: How did Chicago do last nite? Fire man! How come? You not a soccer fan? It's bears and white sox right? And hockey? And bulls used to be better too i guess. U fancy hoops at all? U play tho? I like to play sometime. Yeah always good to hit the ball. Pat: Chicago what? Dunno. Its soccer right? Nah. Baseball and hockey is wot i luv. Bears is football. White sox is baseball. Blackhawks. But not doing well right now. True enough. Jordan times long gone. Not really, not now. Yeah, I still hit 3 points well enough. Good idea. We need to do meet up one day.
Nate: They've just sent me an excel file with all the registrations. Overbooked! A little bit. I guess that's better than having half of the room empty. Let me check. . . Shit this is the worst, the registrations are transformed into text in Excel. Shitty one. I have to create a new file and feed the data into the tables myself. Julie: How are we doing? ? No. . . How many people for the first day dinner? Ok. Omg what registration system is that. What should be do? The worst. .
Enrique: Thanks for sharing your collection with the class. They loved it! Not everyday you get to see some of those up close and personal like that. We were wowed! You have a great collection, you should be proud! Fossils are a unique thing to collect, that's for sure. So it's good to share them. It was for us as well! Will you come back again? I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. Can I give your name and number to that teacher? I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester. Thanks again! It was really interesting! That would be great. Oh, I understand. I'm sure you'll do fine next time with whatever you bring. Our pleasure! . Farrah: No problem! It was my pleasure! Oh, gee, that's so nice! I am, but not everyone appreciates it. If you leave them sitting around, they just become dust magnets! Especially with little kids, they get so amazed! It was a fun day. Of course! Any time! Sure thing. Fair enough. No problem, I understand. Of course! Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time. Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical. Thanks!

John: Look, Bristol Stool Scale - perfect to read in the morning. <file_photo> I was expecting a pic of your poop. Constipations are the worst! My man! I think it's a good metaphor. Yes, like very psychoanalytic. And showing you're not pretentious. Henry:  /. No, sorry. No no, I had a nice poop this morning! I never really am constipated. Maybe I should write it on my tinder profile? "Never really constipated". About emotions etc? Hehe. Maybe still not the best strategy overall though. .
James: Hi girls! When are you flying to Japan? But scared of what? ? Hahaha, you're really a damn alarmist. This is so exaggerated, are you serious? Listen, nothing will happen. First of all the earthquakes happen rarely, even in Japan and only in certain places. It's not like the whole country is shaking all the time. And, most of all, Japanese have amazing architecture because of their experiences with earthquakes. Their cities are super safe. Are you going to be at the coast even? So I don't think the next tsunami in Japan will happen exactly at that place and time, relax and enjoy. Japan is really an amazing country. Mary: In a week! Unbelievable arty. You're such an alarmist! I'm telling her this all the time, but it's pointless. I doubt. Maybe for 2 hours somewhere close to Tokyo. Popper:  Patricia: I can't believe either. I am also increasingly scared. The long flight, earth-quakes. God, and tsunamis! James, I almost never travel, I'm afraid really. What about tsunamis? Mary, are we? Thanks James .

Drade: Mum he got out of the group chatting room. I just said what he had said was wrong! Why should I? I didn't say anything wrong! ! ! ! ! He failed in his business, didn't he? He acted like an asshole first. Marenda: I am sure he is angry! Why did you act that aggressively? You know your brother's temper. Apologize and send the invitation to him. But did you have to talk about it? Language! No need to talk about it more.
Kate: Hey, do you know if our medical insurance covers hospital costs? I broke my arm and they're sending me to the hospital. Thnx. Greg: Hm, it depends. Call Linda or ask someone at the reception, they should be able to tell you what kind of package you have. Mel: What happened dear?

I won't be back before 7 though. Am at the gym. Why don't we go and have a drink? It's Friday evening after all. Eh? Something happened? ! What about? I've guessed so much! Very well. Come anytime after 7 0 and I'll fix us a snack. Beer? Wine? OK CU. But you'll have to park somewhere along the road as my drive's taken by my camper at the moment.

Steph: <file_photo> And whatd'you think? Ikea. Wasn't sure about the colour scheme but the lamps decided. Still need proper hangers, preferably from copper. Not made of copper, but copper coloured.

All right, I looked it up. <file_other> No problem When in doubt, you can do a reverse search on Google Images. Not always accurate but can help a lot in many cases! .
Amber: Hi Erin, guess what, John and Annie are coming back to London! John lost his job in Germany! Yeah, his whole team got liquidated. Yeah, and he was the only one who received an offer from the company to be relocated back to London. But he didn't accept it. B/c they only offered him the job after a month & during that time he started searching for a new one. He got a better offer from a different IT company in London. Exactly, but you know what this means for me? Yup, we had an agreement that I would be renting their place until they returned from Germany. But you know, they planned to be there for at least 5 yrs. She's pretty pissed off. I mean the plan was to save up for a house and only then come back to London. She had already enrolled in German classes & they were starting to feel at home there. Thanks Erin! Annie already told me not to worry, that I can stay with them until I don't find something new. But I've already started searching. Thanks, ttyl. Erin: Hi Amber, wow that's news. What caused the change of plans? What Seriously? No way! ? OK, well at least he's not unemployed. Why not? ! Well good for him! Since they weren't able to appreciate his work and they didn't offer him something right away. You're going to have to search for a new flat. . . I can imagine that Annie isn't happy with this turn of events. That's too bad. Sometimes life turns out to be unpredictable. If you need somewhere to stay for a while, you can always stay at my place. Good luck and let me know if you need any help! Bye! .
Vicky: Is everyone still at town sq? I might have to meet you all at fratellis. Heading to fratellis shortly. I’m here! Audrey: I can be there for 7. 30pm assuming no traffic incidents! Can't get a taxi so Marty and kids bringing me over. . . Will be about ten mins x. Ludovica: Yes, we're here Vicky! We'll leave town Square very soon!

Keira: How come it started with wildangel3 then went to 1 wouldn't it make more sense to go from 1 to 2 and then 3? I figured ^^. <file_gif> WHAT? ! She's grounded for the month. Maybe. . . I'm kinda mad at her right now > . Lois: Yeah, i couldn't get onto my aacount for some bizar reason. But I'm thinking of deleting both - i mean, I created it when I was 10! Mean. Yeah yeah. Btw, I saw your sister in town the other day. SOmeone's in trouble. . . You gonna tell on her?
Natacha: Hi, i can come and pick you up at the RER. Ok ,call me when you'll be at the station Vesinet. Charles: So nice. I just landed. I thinki'll arrive about 5 0pm. I'll give you a call. Thanks . See you.
Helen: Hey, Simo, are you there? I was calling you before. . . It's a bit embarrassing. . . The toilet paper is finished, could you fetch me some tissues, please? Simon: Yep babe, what's up? Sorry I was on the phone, I didn't hear you. . . Tell me. Hahaha sure, no worries! .
Ricky: Did u guys see what's going on outside? This reminds me of a time when I was hiking in the mountains. U don't strike us as the type. So what happened? Shelly: A real blizzard! U went hiking? How many of u were there? Tom: Haven't seen such weather in yrs! Yeah. What's so weird about it? Well, I did. It was a couple yrs back, I admit. I was still a student and we went as a group of friends to the mountains. I think 5 or 6. Myself included. We rented a cabin in the wild. We wanted to have a weekend away. .
Maggie: Lucy. Y u such a diva quinting_face_with. Johny wants to date you. You turn him down big time! See? Diva. Nvm. So youre going with us. OK. Jeeez. Sure, is 6pm cool? Catcha later. Tongue:  Lucy: Whats that about. He just said that if i have time we can go to that gig together. And i wanna go with my besties. If hes into me he'll try more. U jealous or what. If you shut up about johny then yes. You and girs come to my house and we pamper ourselves before. Yass, we need at least an hour. Gig starts at 8, plenty of time. Ok bye.
Rose: Payday's tomorrow. Can I start thinking about Christmas gifts now? I can't wait. I love making gifts for people! Jake: Hahaha. Sure. When I get home, we'll talk about what should we buy for everybody. Yup. Me too. .
Martha: How do you feel about minimalism? If expensive lives longer, ofc. I'm asking because I just saw this documentary about minimalism gurus. And I felt mixed about it. I feel there are so many conflicting priorities when it comes to shopping. If you want to buy durable stuff you usually pick brands you know, big brands. And then it might not be fair trade product. Huh.  . Jake: I used to think it's total bullshit. Like, it's still about spending. But it's about shifting the paradigm from buying cheap to buying expensive stuff. Right. I think it's a good idea to buy things that will serve you longer. But it's so difficult to be mindful about everything you buy. Take leather for example. If it's ecological it's cruelty free but it has higher carbon footprint than leather. So your values clash all the time when you shop.
Albert: I've just passed the driving exam holy fuck! 4th attempt! Juliet: Congrats mate! Now nothing can stop you lexed_Biceps:. Biceps: 
Jaya: Hello Ravi, I haven't seen your mother in the club for almost 4 months. Is she fine? Ravi She is not keeping well these days. So sorry to hear that, what happened? Any specific reason for the pain? Oh, she had always maintained a healthy lifestyle, I wonder how this happened. Did you try naturopathy? Your mother is a strong lady. She never gives up so easily. Please ask her to take care and start feeling better soon. Ravi: She has been suffering from knee pain for almost 5 years now and the doctor has asked her to restrict movement. Its probably arthritis. The doctor said that it can be controlled, but not cured completely. She did have mild ache in her knees for the past few years but had been ignoring it. We tried almost everything. She is still the same, however abiding by the doctor’s advice she prefers to stay at home most of the time. Thanks. I'll pass your wishes to her. .
Lynn: Sorry it's not worth it to have sex with some old wrinkled guy to pay your bills who rubs his old saggy balls all over u ewww fuck that ace_with_rolling_eyes astonished. Can't even imagine. Yes true . Face:  Diana:  I totally agree. And she’s not even that pretty my Lord. But to each it’s own if materialistic as what she craves and I guess she is fulfilling her fantasies. But I don’t want no old balls on my four head LOL no thanks. Steviee: Lots of sugar babies don't actually sleep with them. Sometimes it's purely friendship and companionship. Hahahaha. Wilbur: OMG! ! ! Lynn. . . you've got me laughing so hard! I'm crying! Haha! ! I seriously just spit my soda out! ! ! Lmao. You know what they say, from old egs, comes salmonela lmao. Not all of them expect intimacy some of them just want your company lol. Kellene: Lynn what’s going to happen when you’re in your 60’s and every man close to your age has saggy balls? Will you only date younger men then? Perhaps, this girls sugar daddy’s do exactly that. Justin: Steviee, that's what lots of sugar babies say and want the public to believe, doesn't mean its true. I don't believe what you said for a second.
Clint: Are you better today? Don't be silly. It's just a flu. Poor you. How is it possible that vaccine did not work? Why? Alice: Not really. I have never had such a terrible flu. I think I'm dying. I know but my whole body aches, I have fever and I'm sneezing all the time. I'm home for 10 days and it seems I need more. I haven't taken any vaccine. I don't know, just forgotten. And now I have consequences .

Dane: Morning. How are you. From what ? I'm alright. Ok. Zariah: Morning. In general ok but I have a big pain in my back. U? Almost every day I have had such a pain recently. Maybe because of the bed. But to be honest I don't think so since earlier it wasn't like this.
James: Hey! I’ve been thinking about you ;). What are you up to? I miss u I was hoping to see you. What about tomorrow? Oh ok, what about Sat then? I’ll pick you up at 8? Hannah: Oh, that’s nice ;).

Gloria: <file_photo> I'm too poor for my lifestyle. It's so frustrating! Yeah but bear in mind that my therapy is expensive. I cook. I made sushi and tiger prawn korma. Maybe I should plan my meals better. Thanks for the tip. Amanita: We all are, sweetie. But I thought your salary is pretty decent. Maybe you need to cook more. Those are expensive meals. Pancakes are super cheap. Soups, too.
Haley: I found this old photo on my computer - look how cute Bella was a kitten <file_photo> She was the cutest little baby. About 2 weeks I think. Yup, in cat years she's actually middle-aged. No doubt ;). Jenny: Awwwwwwwww. How old is she in that picture? Haha, yeah, she is. But still totes adorable. Tess: Omg omg omg. I can't believe she's so big now.
Jeff: Have you heard about this Christmas at Wall Street? I've listened to some radio podcasts about the American economy. And it's pretty scary, I mean the economic war on China that Trump is waging and all his unpredictability. But I'm not an economist. And the EU? How do you think? Peter: Yup, was apparently the worst since the end of the 19th century. I know, it's hard to say what may happen because Trump is rather unpredictable. But people in my bank seem calm, at least 2019 should be calm. I agree, I'd expect a global economic meltdown in the early 2020s. Miranda: But it's bounced back since, no panic. Yup, calm, but the global economy will get weaker. And the growth will be weaker but not tragic, I suppose. We just don't know what will happen to the UK and with Brexit. There are many different scenarios possible. But it seems that 2020 may be much worse.
Alexa: I want to confess something. I asked Ethan to Insult you. I was too jealous to see you with Ethan that day, dats why. We would talk about it tomorrow. Hunter: What is it? But why did you do that? But you could just ask me not to do something if you dont want me to?

Adam: I have a juicy gossip for you guys ;). So apparently, Iga planned a weekend getaway with her boyfriend, but they had to cancel because he couldn't talk his group into changing the date of the presentation. What do you think? That is why they aren't sitting together since Monday ;). Borys: About whom? Katia: And she is pissed? Who would have expected such a gossip girl from you .
Samuel: Are you there, Anna? Sorry, brother Tim. Anna is just the word for elder brother in my language. My apologies. It is Telugu, brother. Yes, in South east India. Bangalore and Chennai and other places. Nearly 90 million speakers, brother. No, it is written left to right. It is based on Brahmin script, our writing. If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the Phoenicians, like English writing the same. It is 23 provinces, Anna. But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month. Thammu or Thammadu. You can call me Thammu. I am younger than you. How old are you, Anna? Well there you are you see. I am 35 only. So you are my Anna and I am your Thammadu. That is because it is not an easy life when you are not earning much money, Anna. We work very hard and have very little. But still we are thankful for what we do have. . Tim: I am, but I am not called Anna. It's Tim. It's a girl's name here. Doesn't sound very brother-like. So what is your language? Is that spoken in India? Is it one of those written right to left? Wow. So it must be pretty big, then, Teluguland? So what is the word for "younger brother" if "Anna" means "elder brother? ". How old are you, I would have sid about the same as me in your photo. 55. Wow sorry to say it but you do look old for 35:.
Pete: What flavour yogurt did you want again? My brain is like a sieve today. I'll have a look around. If they don't have pear can I get a different flavour? OK. . Jen: Pear but only if they've got it. Otherwise don't worry about it. I don't like any other flavour. If they don't have pear just don't get anything at all then.
Eve: Where are we meeting? Ok! . Charlie: At the entrance. Nicole: Yes, it's the best place. We would't find each other inside, it'll be too crowded.
Jenkin: Hey what is your spirit animal? Go on? Are you wiley? I am a dolphin. I have been reading about animal spirits its quite good. There is a pack of cards and you choose the one that you are drawn to. Well I didn't know but I was drawn to the dolphin. I will bring them over tomorrow. Sophie: What? I dont know a fox lol. Sometimes. I think you are a bit mad like the mad hatter abbit_face top. You will have to tell me about the fox. . Do you decide what your animal is or does someone tell you? Oh right I would choose the Fox. Oh. Oh yes please that will be great ox fOx:. Ox:  Olphin:  Hat:  Fox:

Chris: I tried jogging today! Sorry. I have no other friends ;). Anyway, I was certain that I'd just collapse after 50m or so but I did quite well. Medication is a different thing. I just don't understand how I can run better when I eat 1/3 of what I should. . . I need to analyse my performance. Maybe I can get even better than that! Oh, you killjoy. You're basically saying that I'll crash during my next jog. Cya! . Matt: And the key word is "tried"? Not to mention that you have the weirdest habit to stat the conversation 5 minutes before my work ends. Good (or bad) thing is that I need to stay a bit longer today ;). It's not a problem for me, you're the one getting a short conversation ;). I would collapse. I'm taking pills that slows my heart rate and that doesn't bode well with any kind of physical effort. My heart doesn't know what to do then. Power of mind ;). And it's your first try in a while. Your body doesn't know what to expect. Back in the days when I was still playing football my first performance after a long break was always spectacular. I always felt like a physical god. But the next ones were just horrible and I felt like I was dying. That's what I'm here for. A reality check. Anyway, done with my work for today, finally can head home! Cya later.
Eric: Yo yo. Have you watched Punisher season 2? I think the first one was better but the second one did some things better. Like showing Frank as the actual Punisher and not just a guy seeking vengeance for his family. Anyway I think they should have given Jigsaw more scars. Anyway it's a shame they discontinued Daredevil. Netflix's walk of shame. Dan: Yo man. Yeah, it was cool. Like what? Yep, season 1 was kinda weird. Yeah. I know. . . Shame shame shame. They're as blind as Matt Murdock but without the radar XD.
Geri: I need to buy some new shoes. Some nice heels. Something sexy. Great! Thanks. Wanna go together check them out. Sounds good. We can get some frozen yogurt. It's been a while since I had some. Ok I'll be in touch. Hilary: What kind? I sa spome great ones at the mall yesterday. Ok maybe 2morrow. After work? Oh yeah. I love that place! It's a plan. Ok .
Jacob: Hey, guess what, top management is coming from France next week. Yeah, we got an invitation via Outlook to the meeting. And mandatory formal dress code required. The usual, cost savings, lean office, lack of salary reviews. . . You know how it is, their visits never result in anything positive. Alex: Hey, again? They just announced it? OMG, I wonder what they're goin to announce this time. That's true, changes for the worse. .
Joana: Wana play some games? Maybe dixit? Or carcassonne? Ok, I'll bring them 2 u. Sandy: What games? Why not? Great .
Jenny: Are we going to that concert on Saturday. I don't know anything affordable nearby. Where is it? Perfect. Jeremy: Sure, it's the only opportunity to hear them. And Barcelona? 8th av. Joan: But we could start with a drink.

Emma: How was New Year's Eve? Sounds cosy. Sounds lame. Oh come on you are not 70. Haha. Yeah we drove to the seaside, visited bunch of clubs. Ended up on the beach for midnight. Had my beer jacket on. I have a cold now. Josh: Nice, just a bunch of close friends at my place. Yeah we had some wine and played board games. Haha nope just getting older. Huge parties and dance clubs are not that exciting anymore. Not 20 either ;). How was yours? I saw some pictures on fb, did you go away? Wasn't it freezing? Lol. That's the risk of a beer jacket! .
Andy: Working late til 4 xx. Be there by 8 xx. Sue: No worries xx. No probs babes xx.
Stewart: Can you believe he even said that about the forests? Raking? Really? He just has no clue. I can't wait to vote for anyone else but him. Yeah, but we couldn't go another 4 years with a Democrat. The country would go broke! You've got a point! I know. How is that even possible? Only on the fringe. We have to make the best of it now. Nothing we can do. Exactly. But that's not for a while. From your mouth to the Dem National Committee's ears! We should volunteer. Get out the voters or something. Let me see what's out there and I'll let you know. Shari: Yes. I can believe that this is an ignorant man. He proves it daily. This just one more example! I mean, there are so many people dead and all he can think to do is criticize the forestry department? With a totally inappropriate suggestion? Puhleeze. I know what you mean. Half my friends voted for him just to see what would happen! Well, guess what? Maybe, but at least we wouldn't be hated around the world and led by an ignorant piece of shit! I'm not sure he will finish out his term, with all the legal problems, but he seems to be able to hold off the big stuff. Somehow. I'm not sure. I mean, he's breaking amendments to the constitution here! Maybe. Except vote him out! Closer every day. If only there was a good candidate. LOL! Good idea. Great! .
Lydia: <file_photo> Would you believe it? I added him on Facebook. He accepted my invitation. I viewed his profile aaaand. . . "engaged"! I don't know. . . Maybe it's a sort of open relationship? Yes, but I'm trying to ignore him. Yeah. . . I'm embarrassed now. But how. . . It was so dirty. That's weird, I know. Do you think I should talk to him? But we work in the same company. I don't want it to be awkward. Yeah, you're right. This scumbug will regret that he met me. . Camila: Say whaaaaat? But how? What a bastard. . . But I don't get it. . . He knew you would see it. Does he still write to you? Gosh. . . If this girl knew. . . You shoulnd't, you didn't know. It's not your fault. And nothing happened. You two just texted. C'mon, how would you know. I can't believe he is still texting you, now. . . When you know everything. . . I wouldn't pull any punches. You're kidding? You should talk to him. It's not fair what he's doing and it cannot be like that anymore! Think about this girl!
Daria: I got a new job. For a law firm! Yeah! ! Thx iss_woman. Kelsey: Wooow where? You go girl! So fast for a new graduate. Well done! ! Congrats! iss_woman. Woman:   iss_woman.  iss_woman.  .
Boris: Due to the number of PTO requests this week, we had to decide who will be allowed to take off based on seniority. Unfortunately, you are too low on the totem pole and we will have to deny your request. I can give you first choice of dates the week after, but that's the best I can do. That is a rare, but yes, I will come to you first. Again, I'm very sorry. Certainly. That should be no problem. Very true. No problems from my side. Yes, please come see my assistant at your earliest convenience. Thank you for being so flexible. That's it exactly. My pleasure. Have a nice holiday and enjoy your time off. Sarah: I understand. Oh, that's too bad! Is there any compromise? I really wanted to have some time with my family. What if someone cancels? Thank you. Could you amend my request for the following week, Monday through Wednesday? That's great, at least I'll have a long weekend! Do I need to initial the change? Certainly, no problem. Sure, I understand we can't all be off. You are just trying to be fair. Thank you again for explaining it so well. Thank you! .
Blair: Remember we are seeing the wedding planner after work. At Nonna Rita's. Haha sure why not. Omg hahaha it was all over her white blouse.  . Chuck: Sure, where are we meeting her?

Steve: Hi, babe. I'm fine. You? Love you, too. Sounds great! Scrumptious. Indeed. Too perfect to be true? Can we handle it together? You know how scatterbrained I am when it comes to shopping lists. Together? Guess so. I don't expect any problems. Sure. Miss you, too *.
Rudi: Hetta, did you see the last trump video. <file_video> It gets worse. <file_other> The whole interview is here. Yeah. Wdym. Not really. Yeah. Henrietta: Nope. What did he do now? OMG. What a jerk. Can't believe he said that about a congress woman. Do you wonder where the limit is? If he will say something that will actually get him kicked out of the white house. Fuck.

I just drank too much, that's eat. Yes, I lost control a bit. I am sorry for that.
Darcy: Have you ever been to Egypt? You travel a lot. Aaron has a connecting flight in Cairo and might leave the airport for a few hours to pass the time. Thats what im thinking. Adam: Why would you think Ive been to Egypt? If you say so, ive only been to a few countries. Why do you ask? I see. Should be worthwhile as long as hes careful.

I can do that! Renee: What else are you wearing? Definitely rethink the outfit. Either way you'll look like a waiter! LOL! Stick with the black pants and see if you have another colored shirt? Not much you can do but black is there? Just trying to avoid you looking like one of the help! White shirt, brown shoes? Just make sure you're pressed, neat, clean and smart and you'll be fine. .

Yeah, not got much choice in the matter. Maybe I'll meet my dream woman there! Rinning. Christ, that came around quick, just the little matter of A Levels and getting into Exeter to deal with. I need such high grades for my course, medicine is a cut-throat world. Hope you're right, babes! Anyway, pub Friday at 8ish? Tania: Why the hell not, college work is really doing my head in with the deadlines! Yeah, saw her in the canteen a couple of days ago, she's thinking of breaking up before Uni. Cutting ties etc. Best to go there single, in my opinion! Why the hell not? ! I can't wait to get out of here and up to Manchester, only 4 months and a bit, now! Hope not! If anyone is suited to becoming a Dr love, it's you, I am positive of it! Hell, yes! See you! . Face: 
Anna: The more I study the more I think it makes no sense. We learn about historical moments in our civilization. We learn names and dates, we learn about great moments of human race and we learn about our mistakes. We learn all of it and get idealistic. We develop utopian concepts of how world should look like. And all of it makes us miserable when we face reality. We face corruption, politics, war, conflicts hatred, egoism. Ignorance is a bliss you know. . . So do people doing HIV tests. The only thing that makes me feel better is actually dark humour. Jerry: Wow. That was kind of depressing. . . I get it. The less you know, the happier you are. However I try to look for positives. Hahaha. Dark humour. I luv it. I feel you .

And that’s the most important thing! . Zandra: Which cake? Oh, of course, there are so many of them, I don’t even know what’s going on. Thank you so much, what would I do without you…. But what about the cake, the party is tomorrow! . The party starts at. Bike… God save us all…. Ok, how about the rest? I have all decorations, starting with them in the morning after kids go to grandma. I know nothing about the food and outside attractions. You’re the best, I have to make for it.

Daniel: I'm packing for the trip, are you done with it? Good you wrote us this I think. Haha, yes, a bit. Michael: Mostly done, don't forget your passport! Sure not! Bosnia and Herzegovina is not in the EU, so we will have a proper border control. No passport, no entry. We planned to go to Mostar and the mountains, so Bosnia it is. Very good. Matt: Is an ID not enough? Yes, we're morons. Brian: Why? I didn't even know we're going to enter Bosnia, I though we're going to stay in Croatia only. Anyway, I'll pack my passport.
Ross: Don't judge me. I was thinking about tonight. . . And. . . I wanna do karaoke. Karaoke is fun. No, but seriously, I'm sure girls are gonna love it too. Deal. You wouldn't.

I buggered up my mocks too and I have to retake the subjects I failed in, it never bloody ends! Oudly_crying.

I'm working for my Uncle Kev at the building site, my cousin was taken on with an apprenticeship in bricklaying last year, maybe do that myself. Why don't you talk to them about it?

They wouldn't serve you anyway, you twat! I'll ask my bro to get us some vodka and cigs, he's cool. Dunno, but I heard she was with Nathan Baker these days. See you man. .

Cool, I'll be putting most of my cash in as a down payment, so I won't have much left for renovations. We're putting down 10. We can get quite a good mortgage rate apparently. This will be the first one in this neighbourhood. 5. We saw 2 last week and 3 last month, but nothing really appealing,. I'm gonna have to liven up the place then. No. Ok, great. See you in 30 min. Frank: Yeah, plus I can talk you into buying it, so we could be neighbours. Ok, thanks. I know all the apts in building 32 are for sale, but I didn't know which one you wanted to buy. Grrr. . . . I'm jealous cause mine's only 65. If you decide to buy it, I have a contractor that does everything, and he's dirt cheap too! How much do you have, 10% or 15%. Alright, sounds good. How many apts have you seen already? But in total? You're gonna love my area. It's so peaceful and tranquil. Ok, whatever. Don't forget to bring a measure. Do you have one of those electronic ones? I'll bring one then. They're super cool and easy to use. You can plan each room by knowing the dimensions. Ok.

He just downloaded Open Office and some other programs and put them on a CD. That's what he did, maybe you should have checked. Yeah, damn. No way, I just bought the software online. If I ever tell you to make your friend Alex get me something, please shoot me in the foot. Stu: OMG, what did I do this time? Right, so? That's what I gave you on that disc. What did Alex do wrong?

Okay, thanks! But don't forget xd. Rosemary: Let me see. . . Yeah. You see. There's a problem. Namely, i don't have a working laptop atm. But does it have all the software? Usb ports? Windows?

Deana: I thought they belonged your Cathreen! Mine either. Look, maybe you feel like keeping them? I seem to have so many sunglasses. . . 8‑D. In this empty place above the radio. In the very back.

No, there are the Capuchin Catacombs with 8000 corpses! Yeah! And you can look at them like museum exhibits. I think they're divided somehow, but have no clue how! Well, partly. Most of them were exhibited in their clothes. Basically only skulls and hands. Start: Palermo in Italy. Mickey: And what's so scary about that? Did you break your nail? I'm writing this one down! That's so precious! Ollie: That's so cool! Do you get to see the bones or are they covered up? Me too! .
Maria: Hi Spence, life treating you well? Getting your name out there! Saw some of your new stuff on Instagram, liked it! Same old, same old. Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing. How do you get new clients, Spence? I really need to pick your brains sometimes! Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, I imagine. Hmm, I'll have to budget carefully when I do it. Well, your passion is obvious! Your stuff is amazing! You've inspired me, Spence. See you soon, hopefully! Spencer: Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that! Yeah, thanks love! How's the call centre? Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations. Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops I sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. I probably get around £1000 of work a month now, before commission and tax. Yes, it's tight, but I am very frugal. Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills. Yes, but it's well worth it. I LOVE the work so much! Well, so was yours in Uni. Don't let your talent go to waste! See ya! .
Tim: Hey, you have a few minutes? I'm thinking about inviting a few people from work over and I kinda thought that maybe some boardgames would be a cool idea. And I wanted to consult the expert on the matter. Haha Ok, So I know you ran the local club - any tips how to organize a newbie gaming evening? And what games to bring? Got it. Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls. . . Yeah, I know, all too well. Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start. Will do that . Joe: Sure, what's up? As you know I'm always happy to share my expertise with anyone willing to listen. You will just need to stop me when I get too wound up. Yeah, sure - just a few general tips. Start games before you start drinking And don't bring any game that is either over-complicated, requires too much time to explain, or god forbid encourages direct conflict - you know, the plotting-scheming stuff. So no Game of Thrones. Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic. Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life. Yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns.
Richard: Hey we have to start. Doing our project real soon. 15 dec. I do! Wanna meet up at Starbucks down 8th street? Ya and We will start planning out stuff. Ok sure inking. Holy: When is it due?

I had flu like that three months ago. True enough. I had the same. Same old, same old, you know. Not much happening in the middle of term. Oh yeah, we won the last match. It was a good game. OK, talk to you later. . Gurdun: Hi Ross, a little bit better, yes, thank you. Not tomorrow for sure, but I hope Wednesday maybe. Yeah. I'm feeling a bit weak still. I believe so. And the muscle pain. Luckily the headache's gone. It was absolutely awful. Anyway, how are things with you? And the team? Great. Listen Russ, I need to run. Catch up later.

Dan: Buy me a sandwich on your way to work. Thanks! . Kevin: Ok, no problem!
Simon: <file_photo> It's funny and scary at the same time. BTW it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of EU significantly. I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation. I mean being economically delayed for few decades. Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made. The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. I admire Poles. I admire them for they will to fight. They never give up. I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe. Let's hope not. I agree . Charlie: This photo is great. It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize EU policy. Berlin has put concrete blocks around Christmas fair, Belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and Paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city. Poland though. . . One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism. The question is - for how long. . . Yup. And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation. Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map. Maybe. But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart. Yup. To. Conclude: Christmas in Poland will be the best Christmas in Europe.

Mell: Hi there! How are you doing? Not much happening either. An odd phone call with the kids. Or Tad's sister ( Not much otherwise. I don't know. Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. In a way I do like this peace and quiet now. I guess you're right. But maybe I should feel guilty or something? Thanks Gloria. YES! Splendid! I'm all for it. At my place? I'd love it. We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion. We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose? Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks? Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you. I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too. Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her. Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday! Gloria: Hi Mell! We are fine, just the daily grind ;) And yourselves? Yeah. . . Life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. We had more to get used to it. But it must hard for you. Especially you I mean. Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now. Don't be silly! You are a fantastic mom. Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. We should really have a nice do again. The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a BBQ. What do you think? Can't be better. I love your garden. I'd love to.

At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday? And I'll get us some dessert as well. Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister? Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her. Yes, we are. Oh I'm so happy you've phoned! So long! .

But he's also quite stupid. And the dangerous thing is his self confidence. He's persistence. And ignorance. Karine: Unfortunately it's much more. This populist strategy to scare people with a minority. And then present himself as the only savior. I really think so, because it's not only about politics anymore. He is destroying the Earth. Trying to shake the world's order. But we have a chance to change it. Maybe Trump will be over soon? Everything! . Peter: Karine is right, I think he's not as senile and stupid as we would like to believe. Possibly yes.
Madison: <file_other> I saw this offer today. Exactly. Tickets cost pretty penny, but the rest is extra cheap. Adam: Thailand? ? Not to expensive? ? Taylor: And children under 12 --> 50% off. Jordan: Seems ok.
Tina: Hey, Facebook is constantly non stop suggesting Patrick. I think I have to catch a bit of your approach. I have to learn how to transfer from hating men to fucking them haha.

(Y) currently i like men. You have to be chilled with them ;).  maybe its a mistake. . . I dont know. Lets organize workshops on that. Done! But maybe you should chill a bit, look around for ather types . . . and see what happens. I know! I know it well! You have to isolate one bit inside that will be always independent. For sure. If youre homeless i will take under my roof. We ll find something.
Freddie: Nanna, are you coming to visit us soon? I forgott. Well come soon. Yes love you. Leg better soon? Winnie: Oh darling, Nanna has broken her leg, you'll have to visit me instead. Good, ask Mummy and Daddy and they will come when they can. Yes, quite soon. Tell mummy to ring me. Bye darling xxxxx.
Mark: Who wants to go and see'Batman. New Beginning' this Sat at 7? Cool. I can get tickets for us all. Clint: Me! Thats great. Phil: Me too!
Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room. I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows. Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow. Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls. I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen. I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees. Not necessarily. That would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else. I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself. It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. Of course, I will have that done by Friday. No problem, speak soon. . Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? Why is that? So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? But not in other rooms? So why only that bedroom and not the other ones? But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then? Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation? So what would you recommend? That sounds good. Would that be sufficient? OK, is this something your company can help with? Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email? That would be great. And again, thanks for today!
Gina: Did u lock the door. Good, thanks. Warren: Yes.
Claire: Hey. Where's this conference about relations at school? Oh, in Sesame Street? Thanks! Are you going? I mean apart from your own lecture ;D. I see. Jo's. . . Is it the one about stress? Ah, this one. Yeah looks interesting. I was thinking maybe mindfullness. . . Sounds wonderful. One can easily tell you're one of the organisers ;D. Ok oki'm signing up see you there, during the breaks at least;). Aaron: Hey. It's in the teaching training thing. Yeah exactly. Haha yeahi'm giving two, actually. Andi'm kind of a host there as well. So guessi'll be looking to coffee, biscuits etc. I was thinking i could go to Jo's lecture. No, that's Joe ;D Jo is having a workshop on teamwork. I know her, she's a really good coach. Yeah definitely! ! If you haven't been to any mindfullness workshops then it's a must! I've taken it in Berlin last year, with the same guy. It was amazing, life-changingi'd say. Hahah yeah but we did choose the best topics and presenters, believe me. We've checked out all those people and learnt from them and yeah, they're the best ;). Ok bye bye;).
Kate: I've just heard you want to sell your flat? ! Ha ha! I wish. . Sure. You moved in a year ago or so? ! Why do you wanna sell it? It's not that bad. Mine is smaller and I have two. You're right. So are you looking for two bed now? That's sounds reasonable. I can only imagine. It's getting more expensive year after year. Good luck with that! ;). Rob: That's true. Do you want to buy it? I'll give you a discount ;). We're thinking about having a baby and it is too small. There's no room for a cot in our bedroom. Three bed would be perfect so that we won't have to move out again when we decide to have another baby. I know. It just the prices. . Total madness! ! ! I've got a friend who's relocating to another city so want to sell his flat ASAP and offers a good price. We're seeing him tomorrow. Fingers crossed! ;).
Allison: You talked to Ethan about the function? What did he say? Can you do something about that? K. Evan: Yeah I did. He might not come. I will try to make him come.
Charlie: How are you doing. Where are you now? Pity, I hoped you may be still in Sicily. I am still thinking about the evening we spent together. I would like to meet you again. Either in the US or here. And you're flying to NY? Too bad. I think I will take a train to Florence. More than sure. When are you going to be there? Perfect. I want to see this amazing city with you. Me too! . Daisy: Good, seeing a lot of beautiful places. In Naples. No, we took a ferry early in the morning yesterday. Yes, it was nice. But where? But we're heading North now. Rome, Florence, Venice. No, directly to San Fransisco. I know. Wow, are you sure? 1-5 of September. I am looking forward to it!
Adele: I am still listening to that song. One you recommended me. Yes it is. Omg is it that old? Can you suggest some others from the same singer? When you would come to my home? I am waiting then. Kode: Which one. Yeah thats good one. I have that in my music library for 3 years. Hmm. I give you whole Album in USB. I am free right now. Coming.
Maddie: What's the story with Claire? Really? I spoke with Leah and she told me that you dumped her years ago. Weird. Maybe she was thinking about someone else? I'll ask her next time. Sorry about the confusion. Ian: Claire? I don't know any Claire. . . Are you sure she was talking about me? I tend to forget things but I do remember my past girlfriends. And believe me none was named Claire. Most likely. I barely know her. I think we met for the first time like 1,5 years ago. Don't worry. Take care! .
Violet: Hi! Do you know any good waxing salon in the neighbourhood? I'm going on vacation andi'm as hairy as a gorilla XD. Was it that bad? ! ! ! I was going to get brazilian waxing, but nowi'm scared. Yup. I use scrubs and moisturize my skin almost every day but it's still bad. I mean REALLY BAD, i look like a freaking chicken with all these razor bumps. I've tried everything. I just need to man up and make an appointment. Thanks. Paisley: Waxing? Wow, girl, you're brave. I've been in a waxing salon once andi'm not going back. Waxing is painful af. Leg waxing was ok-ish, but bikini. . . Jesus. I was bleeding so fckin hard. Blood was EVERYWHERE. That's extreme. If i were you, i'd start from leg waxing or sugaring. But why won't you just shave down there? Ingrown hairs? Try shaving with the grain. It helped with my ingrows. Good luck, then ;).
Suzy: Don't forget to follow me on Instagram. Come on, nice pictures ;).  Linda: Do I need to? Done. You're welcome ;).
Sean: Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. Let's get those last minute trade request sent. Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB! Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I guess we will have to talk about after the season. 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league. . . Rick: So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb? ? Crazy it happens though! He one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar. People's evidence #658 why the QB rule doesn't work. Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. That solves a large percentage of the issue tho. John: I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait. . . In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances. I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year. As I said, we can look at if after the season. I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far. .
Lisa: Have you ever heard about this diet? ? <file_other> Omg, glad that I asked. <file_gif> . Victoria: Nooo. Hmm, seems interesting. Amelia: YES! ! My mum was on that crazy diet. . . . . She gained 5 pounds (ー_ー)! !
Carrie: Just back from Fantastic Beast. Generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the US. Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good. No worries ;). And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt? Not your standard protagonist, that's for sure. Go see it. If' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ;). Gina: And what do you think? I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied. I loved him I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character. And that's what I liked about him. Alex: Sounds cool. I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews. No spoilers, girls. Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it.
Amelia: What is your favourite colour? I can't tell you. Sort of. . . Can't tell you anything more. Sorry. Emily: Blue, why? A surprise? =). I'm super curious.
Jenny: Where does Mary live now? Maria: In Southampton. Louis: Yes, she moved there in December.
Shanon: Yeah. So what bout him? Bt y? What? ! Victor: He's no longer our teacher. I suppose he's had it and lost it. Oliver: I'm so happy. Literally thrown out! Or maybe had one too many ;). Sid: Me too! He got fired 2day and thrown out of school? Not. Our. Teacher. Anymore! .
Pedro: Batman or superman? ? WHAT? ? Whats so good about the flash. Not anything. Superhuman speed? Thats your pitch? Yeah i get your point. Alex: Honestly. . neither. I honestly like the flash. Duuude, he can do almost anything. Yea im sure batman can run as fast -_-. That speed opens up the whole multiverse for him. . You seriously dont get how powerful he can be.
Marek: Bro, check this out. <file_picture> That's the best part. I didn't find it. I made it in she shopping mall, on the escalator! Pretty cool, isn't it. Dude. This is some guy's ass. I'm a gay, remember? Adam: Whoa, that's some fine piece of ass. Where did you find it? ? What? Dude, that's creppy. One thing is to send me pic of nice ass, it's always appreciated. But another is to walk around and take pictures on your own. Like some creep. Think about it, she might have been someone's sister or daughter. Shit.
Mark: What are we doing tonight? Casino? I will totally get mine this time. Predrinks at your place? Hannah? ? ? I haven't seen her for like 14 years! ! She hot? All right all right drinks at my place. Daniel: It's supposed to rain so the river bank parties are not an option. Don't you have enough after the last time? Hahaha ok. My sister is visiting. Yes.  dude that's my sister. Okay! .
Adrian: Did you get your grades yet? Wait whaaat? Why? Ouch. That must hurt. Why don't you re-take the class next year? I didn't do that bad. I ended up with a reasonable grade. I just pay attention during class, I don't study that much actually. Anyway, why didn't you study for the economy final? What happened? Oooohh I know that game but you better stop slacking off. You can play them, just don't loose focus and study for the exams. Bart: Yeah. My whole semester is screwed up now. Well, I bombed my economy final and ended up with a bad score. . Well, it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have. That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up. How did you do this semester? Well someone did his homework. Classes are boring, can't pay attention for too long. . . Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class. I started playing StarCraft and ended up wasting a lot of time. You're right. I'm not going to play games during school anymore. Let's see how it goes xD.
Don: What did you buy for Nancy's birthday? Margot: A bottle of nice wine. Yvonne: I didn't buy anything yet .
Amelia: Just wanted to say again, thank you so much for coming to Elliot's birthday party. He loved it! It wouldn't be the same without you guys xx. Lindsay: No worries, Finlay had a lovely time! Thanks for having us! Glad he had a good time! X.
Jennifer: Hey do u like mad max. Coz the latest film is on Netflix now. Wanna watch it with me? Ok, tomorrow evening? Awesome . Jack: Seen it, it's pretty dope. But might as well watch it again. Sure. Reece: Yeah me too. Great movie. Fine with me.
Sean: After much thought I’ve decided that my spirit animal is a tortoise. Apparently everyone has one now, I only found out about this recently. Tbh I felt lost, like who even am I? After many days of thinking about I finally decided that I am in fact a tortoise. You would be a wasp. Tiffany: That would explain a lot. Are you sure you're a turtle? Maybe you're just haunted. .
Henry: Good to see you back ) How is the baby? Have you got any photo? She's sweet! Congratulations ). Mary: Good to be back ) Susie is great. I'm so happy ). <file_photo> Thank you ).
Greg: Hi Mum, how's the cat doing? Thank God, been worrying about her all day! Good, see you at home, bye! . Patti: I just rang the vets, she's fine! They said I can pick her up later. I'll pop home and fetch the cage after work. Should be there at 5ish.
Kate: I'm at the grocery store. Do you like some fruits for school tomorrow? Okay, I'm getting me one too. No the're coming next week, I asked already. George: Oh yes please, an apple would be great. Do they have tangerines yet? Okat then we have to wait.
Sam: <file_gif> Good afternoon, is this available? I'm interested in this product. Are the earphones available? Where can I collect them? Okay. Are they new? Do you have any other colors that white? Then I would like the white ones please. The total costs £187 - can I lower the price to £180? ? Oh, okay. How long does it take for the product to arrive? Lia: Hi, how can I help you? Yes, they are. Well, you can have them delivered to you through courrier - this costs £4 (pay on delivery). I'm afraid collecting them personally is a little difficult, as the product can only be collected in Garstang (where the company is located). Completely new - we also offer grey and pink. Okay, so I just need your address and telephone. Fraid not - company policy. It generally arrives the next day, in rare instances it's longer. .
Kelly: Should I put on the red dress? Bloody Mary! Meghan: Oh yes! ! ! ! Mary: I'll wear a red dress too, and bright, red lipstick. Hahahaha.
Kate: Can i borrow your blue handbag? Friday, I need it for Monica's wedding. Perfect! Thanks sister. Emilly: Sure, when do you need? I can bring it with me to the office tomorrow if you want. Always .
Gina: Hey love, do you have a free usb by any chance? Can I come up to your office? Thanks! . Monica: Yes, I do. Of course, usb's ready. 2nd floor, room 112.
Nathan: I want to buy myself a bike in spring. I was thinking of hanging it on the wall, there are some special hooks. I don't want to, people who do that annoy me, it's hard to walk around with all these bikes striped to the handrails. Yeah, well I also got a stationary bike so I can be in shape during winter. Ye, I do like 25 kilometers everyday. My goal for the summer is 100 kilometers. Aubrey: That's great but where are you gonna keep it? Your apartment is so small. You can always keep it in the hallway. I agree. . . Didn't think about that. Really? I am so proud of you! ! That's a lot! Fingers crossed! .
Parker: Yo do you know anything'bout the arrowverse. Do you know its all connected to the DC Universe. Yea man i know, still. . Obviously. Btw have you downloaded the latest episode of arrow season 7. Text me when its done. Yea i know -_-. Jason: Yea. That wasn't really hard to know Park. You like the dc universe better than the marvel right? Yea me too. Its still downloading. Dont come without a usb. Cool.
Michael: Hey, how are you. Haha yes. At airport on my way back. Looong trip. Argentina brazil and chile. 2 weeks, lots of flights to make it work. I'm in Boston next weekend! Just because I found a cheap ticket ace_savoring. Hmm well. . I can deal with the cold now. Hmm, a little bit but not really. I’m more scared to stay in London and do nothing, because I’m so bored of it. Well sort of, for fun stuff, but tired of work. Hahah. Thinking of resigning earlier than I was planning. I don’t have an answer to that one yet, and it’s not really a solution because I’d need to work 2 months notice period anyway, but I’ve just lost motivation after 3 years. Yes asap. Maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative. True, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? Too much work? That’s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which I had just before I went on holiday. Kai: Hey! I am fine, just working too much. What about you? You travel so much! Where have you been now? Wow! How long? Really? ? ! How come? Nice but it's cold. Are you not tired of all this travelling? I see, a man full of energy. Yes, I remember quite well ace_savoring. And then? Would you like to leave London? For the Netherlands? Depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also. Yes, I basically never rest these days. Probably, I have a conference 8th of Dec, then I'll rest a bit, I hope. . Food:  
Carol: I got some more fruit from my garden you want some? I have so much I don't know what to do with it. Ugh so don't have the time for that. Really? Thats your argument? Same argument ass. ? Does everything? What hte hell are you on? You can pick up the fruits Wednesday at 6pm. Jacob: Yess! Always? But aren't you gonna eat it? Make some preserves with it. Oh come on. Well. . . Come on. You aren't one of those super busy people. You know. . . A person that does everything, goes to every new place. Fine nevermind, when can I come? Ok.
Molly: D‑':. I can't think anymore today! Seriously! It's the silly season, isn't it? Trying. . . Driving me nuts! Yeah, you're right. Modest, too. . Luca: What? ? ? LOL! Deep breath. . . Yep. Just hang in there. Try harder! LOL! I know, but you can't let it get you down! Of course I am! LOL!
Mom: Hi Dear. Just want to hear from you. I love you too, Janette. What's new? What happened? Janette: Hi, Mom. So nice of you. I love you. Oh, Mom. I don't know how to tell you. Mom, I've got mice in my kitchen! .
Madison: Hello Lawrence are you through with the article? Okay. But make it quick. The piece is needed by today. Lawrence: Not yet sir. But i will be in a few. Sure thing. I will get back to you once i am through. .
Ronald: How's your weekend? Doesn't sound like you're enjoying it. I'm sorry. Call me when you get back. I've got something to tell you, and I'm sure you're gonna piss rainbows. Sth like that. Julia: Fine I guess. . . Ehh. My parents are having a fight over where should we eat. And honestly I don't event want to eat with them anymore. Yup. Me too. Hahaha. I can see the giraffe from Skittles comercial.
Guido: Hi, Agata, are you OK? I just have trouble understanding your posts on Facebook. Maybe it's because I don't know anything about Java? Don't worry. Sounds like Chinese to me. It's hard to understand the concept. I can see that you enjoy it. And what about you husband? Doesn't he complain about your new job? So you don't speak to him in Chinese language? I mean in JavaScript language, hahahha. Agata: Hi, Guido. Sure, I'm OK And you? Really? Thanks for the concern All my Twitter posts go to my Facebook account. I think I might change that! By the way, it's JavaScript, not Java. Except for the name they really have not much in common.  Sorry. After just one month of coding I would be like plain English to you. I really do. Finally I found something interesting for me. What about him? Not at all! Why would he?
Alejandro: We’re going to meet in 2 weeks time! Took us 3 months xD. I have a feeling that you already know me better than most of the people…. Seriously, I feel a strange connection with you….

Adam: Hi Mum! Yes, just finished packing. Can you remind Dad that the plane was rescheduled and will arrive one hour later? There's no point for him to wait that long at the airport. Nah, I'm fine with anything you'll prepare. Especially if you compare it to what I'm eating on a daily basis. I'll be there in less than 24 hours. I'm sure you can wait. I'm not. I miss you all as well. See you tomorrow! Hannah: Hello, ready for your flight? Sure, I will. Do you want anything special for dinner tomorrow? Alright. Can't wait to see you! It's been half a year since your last visit, so don't be surprised! Bye! Have a safe flight! .

Spectacular! I’ll send you some photos. We didn’t go anywhere specific if that’s what you’re asking. Just spent most time walking along the seaside chilling. Was the weather ok? Is there anything else you wanna tell me? OMG! ! ! I knew he was up to something! Congratulations! I’m so happy for you both! Susan: Oh, it was lovely! We left Fri afternoon and got back Sun evening. Yeah, definitely. We stayed in a 4-star cosy hotel near the beach. I know. Could stay there forever! How about the food? And the scenery? So what did you do mostly? Sounds amazing! It was. Well. .

Breonna: Melissa so are you ok with men acting like pigs and grabbing you whenever they feel like it? So why you’re saying this? Melissa: Of course not! No one is saying men should behave like animals. Its that kind of thinking that makes men afraid to just be masculine in general though. Not all men are pigs. Poor him. Hailey: Thank you! I had a friend get yelled at by a girl for 5 minutes because he held the door for her and said “Ladies first”. Yeah, I felt sorry for him. Christine: Men aren't allowed to be men? How? Holly: Melissa yes this! Michelle: Not one of those fruit loop "feminists" speak for me! ! ! In fact MOST women cant stand them. Gtfoh with your pussy hats, your metoo crap, you "screaming" at Potus through your vaginas etc. Dont try to shove your thinking on everyone. How about HIMTOO! ! ! I LOVE OUR strong REAL MEN! ! ! ! TOO BAD IF ANY OF THOSE CRAZY CAT LADIES DONT LIKE IT.
Zoe: <file_video>  *. Frank: Love you! Have a good day, babe *.
Stefano: Hi, Josie! So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it? Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. Really? What did he say? What? Rotfl! Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum. . . I know, it was a typo! Hahaha. You're the one who said it! Josie: Ciao, Stefano! It's. . . Weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so. . . Nerdy. Yes, I know. . . I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate. And what about Foucault's Pendulum? Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. That's what Salman said. . . De gustiBus! Disgusting pus! Yuk! That's so creepy. I know. ;).
Evan: Hi Dennis, I need to cancel my lesson tomorrow, sorry. Oh, got the flu, been off college since Tuesday. Should be ok for next Thurs. Bye, Den! Thanks. . Dennis: Fine, what's up? OK, just tell me in good time if you can't make it. Hope you feel better soon.
Patrick: Any plans for tonight? Me too. Later we can go party. . Camille: Nothing. We could go out. Cool. What time are you guys going? I'll come. Amanda: I'm going to a concert. In the city park. It's a free event. You can join us! Around 9 p. m.
Bobby: U know what annoys me the most? That too, but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals, medicine and drugs. They may well be, but not for my wallet! I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on. Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses! No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of. So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution. I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness. So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with? That in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products! Absolutely! Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast? Right? Do u know how much the pharmaceutical industry is worth today? At least $1. 2 bln! Mickey: Not being able to watch TV or listen to music without pesky interruptions? Y? Aren't they good 4 ur health? What do u mean? And what of it? What? Are u sure? So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. All right, this is quite serious. What? Srsly? ! How long do u think they've been lying to us? That is kinda puzzling. So why is no one doing anything about it? No. Explains a lot. .
Dave: Hey, do you have any notes from statistics? Mine don't even exist ace_with_tears_of. Oh okay. There you. <file_other> You're. Of course. You bet! Notes don't write themselves. Greg: Hey man.

Charles: What are you up to this weekend? Sounds good. We are going to visit the German markets this weekend. Birmingham and Manchester both. Sausage overload! Allegedly there are Christmas things going on but I just go for the sausage and beer! I know! Oh, yeah, they are good. Try the mulled wine too. That's nice. Yes, exactly. And lots of spices. Usually a red but sometimes they offer a mulled white. Inspired us to make our own at Christmas last year, but nobody else drank it. More for me! But oh the hangover. Anyway, that's the plan. Hope you have fun. Thanks! . Camilla: Not much. Just some work and errands on Saturday, show Saturday night. Day of nothingness on Sundy. Ooh, that sounds really good! What a shocker. I'll have to try to get there this year. I've not been for ages. Never had it. Is it served hot? I'm good with red. Bummer! LOL! You too!
Pamela: Have you tried applying for the RGS grant? Do you know if I have to be a member? Ok I'll have a look at their website . Zoe: I did last year. Wasn't lucky. . . It depends on the award. Xiara: Me neither.
Colin: Hey I have some news that you would be really interested! (´･ω･`). How tall are you you said? Congratulations! You are defeated by penguin(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞. Penguins' average height is 162cm when they stand up （‐＾▽＾‐）オーホッホ. So you are officially shorter than penguins☜(⌒▽⌒)☞. Ava: What is it? 158. . . cm. . Why? (-_-メ). What are you talking about?

Forster: Cloete wanted to go to the mountains so i guess that's my plan. Could we come over too. Sure thing 8 pm is fine?
Lee: I'm scared and confused. The digital wizard client manager who normally wears only hoodies, just put on a proper dress shirt and a suit jacket. The Russians are coming! If I'm not mistaken, he has some sort of a client related presentation. But it's still weird. I've been here for almost 5 months and this is the first time I see something like this. I should. Quick picture and post to FB. Yeah! But on a more interesting topic, I went and pre-purchased RoS CE in a temporal break of my brains. Digital. Pet for WoW, some decals for SC2. Pre-ordering opened up a hero in a game not yet released. Yeah, preorder. . . Wait, wait! Wings! Wings and a Demon Hunter for Heroes of the Storm. Although wings not applied yet and I prefer the look of the wings from the original CE. <file_other> Well yeah but I just took a quick bullet when I still had some money on my account. . Andy: Maybe he has a date after work? Possibly with a Russian soldier ;). Take pictures and make fun of him in a couple of weeks. The corporate one! Digital or the "real" one? Did it unlock any features already? So basically you got some goodies that you would get anyway by buying it closer to launch date? "or anyone who redeems a Reaper of Souls retail game key on or before March 31" - so basically what I said.
Maya: Bring home the clothes that are hanging outside. All of them should be dry already and it looks like it's going to rain. Fine, thanks. Boris:  I'm not home right now. I'll tell Brian to take care of that.

I guess we can meet up tomorrow and go fetch something for her. Lets just meet at jades at around 5 pm. Yeah, that place. .
Adam: Good morning! ! Cathy told me u got a new cat. A siamese. Oh it’s a girl. She'll warm up to you. What's her name? That's a really beautiful name. Any special reason behind it? Lol what's that? ? ? HAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA. U didn't know that? Are you doing anything about it? That's good, it's really good that they're working. Don't worry, i'm sure if the medications are working right know this won't be a huge deal. Rachel: Good morning adam! Yes! ! And I lover her. Yeah, I head they're less troublesome and friendlier. Although this one doesn't seem very loving. Portia. Not really, I've just always liked the name D. There's only one thing i don't like about portia…. I DISCOVERED I'M ALLERGIC TO CATS! ! ! ! ! Nope, I just discovered it. I get sneezy and rashes and other reactions. Yeah I'm taking a bunch of medication and it seems to be helping. I don't want to get rid of her.

Yeah me too, that's why i asked it's Mark's wedding so i am gonna party till i drop. That will be me . Kristina: After the wedding? I think it will last till the morning. . .

Jane: Are u free now? Could u help me with that thesis? Oh. . . Hmm ok. Hope u will get better soon. . . . Ainsley: I'm sick won't be of much help sorry. I've got a cold and I'm sneezing like a little bitch every 2 seconds.
Felipe: Your legs are amazing. I hope you don't consider that sexist or offensive. Lydia: Well, thanks. Of course I don't! Months at the gym are finally paying off XD.
Amka: Have you ever been to Erasmus? And how are you spending Halloween? I propably won't dress up.  Aaahhh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she's feeling better <file_gif> What are your plans now? Just gonna stay in? Fair enough I never used to do anything for Halloween. I like it. . Mick: I've never done any student exchanges before. That sounds like a lot of fun. It's good you're doing a lot of this. T'll make your CV 10x better. Im'm gonna go to da club with my friends for Halloween loool. There was a plan for me to go to London for Halloween. With my grandparents. But my grandma is having some health issues. And the plan does'nt exist anymore. Yeah. Nothing special <file_gif> In Poland we actually don't celebrate Halloween and don't do all this dressing up, pumpking curving and so on.

I mean sure, I know it’s… inappropriate xd but still, he’s only 5 years younger than me. I knoooow when I come back home after the class I can’t do anything for like an hour or two, I just listen to the music. I mean I don’t expect anything, we’re from different worlds but… Yes, I just want to be around him. All the time xd. Are you crazy, I can’t! ! What would my boss say if she knew. How can I know what will he do, he can tell his mother as well. Wanda: What again. Conrad? IT IS YOUR STUDENT. It’s so fucked up, I knew you are crazy before but it’s too much. You’re literally in love with him. So you need to do something about it. Why not. Will she know? Just go for it! ! .
Tim: The situation there is terrible now. Yup, just the same story all the time. Hard to say what should be done. This for sure. John: I know and, honestly, I don't think it's gonna change any time soon. Exactly, too much money involved. Everybody wants it's resources, they are crucial for the US, for China, for everybody. Exactly. Ebola, war, militias, diamonds. . . Surely the elections were not done properly. Jeremy: Why? I think the world's attention is now on Kongo really. Alice: For our smartphones. Yes, I'm not very positive either.
Margaret: Hi, in December I'd like to meet on 4th and 11th around 10 0 or 11 0. Okey. And what about 18th? Okey, so we'll see. If it's not 18th, maybe we could meet on 17th? Okey, I get it. Hm, I'm not sure whether I'm avaliable. Okey and we see each other 4th 10 0. Evans: Hi, 4th - we can meet at 10 0. And 11th - at 11 0. I'm not sure about 18th. I might not be in town. Yes.

I've got this 1 interview and it really doesn't make me famous. . . Hahaha. I'm flattered I'll be home in 1 hour. . Like: "We're glad that you found yourself a decent man".
Iris: Anyone know how to fix this? Trying to remove myself from an. Doesn't say. But probably juls? I’m gonna try. Gracias. Expense: > This expense involves a person who has left the group, and thus it can no longer be edited. If you wish to change this expense, you must first add that person back to your group. Ken: You got the email address of the person? Yip. Fixed it - absorbed Juls extra cost so we can remove her from the group again. True that - let me know when you are doing that and I'll add her back in. No worries, we got this. I guess by the end of the month – something unpredicted always pops up in the meantime so we have to recalculate again. Sara, George. Luke: Probably have to delete that expense and re-add it. It's the car right? Gerardo: We will need to add her towards the car rental price. Speaking of which, I’m gonna ask the peeps leaving early to stay in the splitwise group until the end of the month. It’s gonna be the $ for gas too. Julia: Ooops, that’d be me. Let me know how much I owe u so I can wire. George: We will, my man.
Ola: Hey running late. I should be free by 8. Kurt: Sure no prob, call me.
Conny: Hello Mr. Fitz. It's about this paper you told me to write for next week. I did some research. And frankly, I found pretty much nothing. Mostly internet, obviously. Sure, everything should be there. You did? Doubt it. But I'll go Mr. Fitz. Obviously. . Fitz: Hello, Conny. What can I do for you? What about it? Where did you do your research, Conny? Obviously? Didn't I suggest you go to library. Certainly. Try it. You might find it's fun.
Louis: <file_gif> <file_gif> True! Hahahahah. Lol! It's her! I disagree, sir! She looks absolutely gorgeous with straight hair. Archie: Wtf? Lol! That one looks like Melanie. Just like in this pic. <file_photo> By the way, she was way hotter when she had cury hair. Oh well, you have the right to an opinion even if it's wrong XD.
Carly: She's so stupid <LOL> How could she do that. She really asked him. Ok, talked to u latter. Cindy: I know, right ;D. I know <LOL> Yeah, she did <LOL>  .
Kirsten: Youth group this Friday, don't be late. 7 pm. We're going bowling, so we'll meet up and then all go together. Bye. Alex: What time? Cool. See you.

Jess: Guys, last night I dreamt I was a lion tamer, does it mean I should go to Africa this summer? XD. Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth. No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;). Do you believe in dreams, Lynn? I guess? So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood? Lynn: Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper? You've just spoiled all the fun! Well. . . I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think? WOW, it sounds really cool! . Charlie: Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat? Do you really believe that dreams can mean something? I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream. Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage.
Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance? Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something. I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much. I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare. I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet. Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me. Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death. I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me. When it comes to intolerance. . . I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine. But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better. You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food? It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm. Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong? My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine. But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this? Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those. <file_other>, <file_other> I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now. It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens. You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat. Articles: 
Ulysses: Did you see your grades? I got an A. Peter: Yes. Me too. Julia: B. Online. On the course page. Martha: Where can I check them?
Ralph: Hey brewski, did you hear that decent polish joke? How do you sink a polish battleship? Put it in water. Hahaha. Andrew: No? Umm, shoot it, bomb it? Whatever. Dude, that’s gotta be the worst joke ever. It got my mouth so dry, that now I have to take a sip of water. .
Linda: I missed the train. In one hour. It was 80 euros. Return to Amsterdam. I was shocked! ! . Joseph: When is the next one? Darcy: Not a tragedy.
Martha: Hey, can I ask you a question? We don't, but do you mind if I ask you about the lenses from your profile picture? They are awesome and I would like to buy the similar ones. Thanks! ! ! I'll check them. Ophelia: Do we know each other? It's from Crazy Lenses. They have quite reasonable prices and very fast shipping. No problem .
Linda: Hi Dad, I want to buy flowers for mum! But I don't remember which one she likes. That doesn't help! I'm on a flower market right now! <file_photo>  What about carnations? Thanks Dad, srsly…. <file_photo> Michael: Well, she likes all the flowers I believe. Send me some pics then. Tulips are nice, roses too. No, carnations are boring.  What about freesias? She likes them a lot, are there any there? Take those! .

Well i guess it will take him some time after landing, reclaiming luggage etc. Great.
Joanna: They are sending emails about Lewandowska. <file_photo> She is hospitalized because she has measles. Anyone who had contact with her within the last couple of days must get vaccinated. I did, she is my thesis mentor. They are organizing vaccinations in the main building from 17th until 19th. I know. . . And I just started working so I really don't have a lot of time. I will try to do it before work on 18th, hopefully I won't lose the entire day. . . . Merve: What happened? Wooow! She had what? Luckily I didn't see her since the last semester. . . What will you do? You have to go! Come on, this is really important.
Thelma: I dont have anything to wear. But i have to look wonderful. Really? It would be great! Louisa: Your wardrobe is full of clothes. Ok i can bring you my red velvet dress. No problem ;).
Megan: Are we going to take a taxi to the opera? Great, more convenient. Joseph: No, I'll take my car. ;).
Carl: Where are u? I'm still waiting for u! ! ! Meg: I need 5 minutes more, I've lost my key somewhere .
Kim: Hey Ben, I see you are online today. You are offly quite this days did you know that? What’s that got on your post? Let me see,. . You are right. What are doing tonight Ben, pizza with coke ? Like we did it last time? Sure, So, will I see you tonight. I'll be waiting. . . Ben: Hey. Nothing just having a downtime.

Erin: Yeeeep. . . it touched me as well finally eary_face weary_face weary_face weary. Good to know that my feelings are shared with other 399,999 people eary. That’s not a good moment to brag ee-no-evil. They will. . . Have faith. . . . Face: Now they screw all my plans to go to Egypt. . .    Nathan: Relevant news story for everyone to. Consider: Http /waterfordwhispersnews. com/2017/09/18/ryanair-cancel-effort-to-improve-brand-image/. Elijah: I’m lucky for now, none of my 2 flights have been cancelled olded. Not me. . . Yet… my 2 flights are confirmed for now. Hands:  Monkey:  Ava: I think we were all unlucky with the ryanair fiasco. . . I hope they can at least send me a voucher xpressionless.
Rachel: I'm at the hospital, my aunt was in an accident. . . Yes, she's bruised but she's fine. Thank God. . . Some jackass was speeding and didn't see the red light. . . Yes, he's gonna pay for the rehabilitation. I will, thanks . Jessica: Oh my God, is she alright? ! I'm so sorry, what happened? Did they catch him? Better than nothing I suppose. Give you aunt a hug from me, please (a light one ).
Michelle: OMG! OMG! OMG! Got news! You won't believe it! I can't believe it! So excited! You remember Monica? That's the one! Well, we had an office party two months ago. . .

What about her? So? How friendly? So? C'mon! You don't say! She told him yet? More? This is going to be good! So? I just spilt some water! Keep me posted!
Luke: Wow I got my ass kicked surfing today. 0 waves, 3 wipeouts and 1 surfboard to the head! (can't wait to go back though ). Low tide is 2 2PM tomorrow. I'll be out there. Oh yeah? Yesterday was low tide. I thought that's best cuz you can see the rocks. Well I'd rather seem than** run into them. When the tide is out you're not surfing over the rocks. Ken: Yaaaay welcome to the tumble dry club - some days is great others just a knock about. Summer: I almost lost my tooth one time ;) Hopefully next time is better! Eric: I thought mid tide is generally the best ? Seeing rocks is a bad thing. I mean, you want to be aware of where they are for sure. But rocks in your vision = no bueno.
Alex: Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game? You should have been there. It was intense. Our team was victorious. It was a great game. Everything alright tough? Oh sorry to hear that. Hope she makes a fast recovery lexed. Glad to hear that! Our team won 101-98. That's the reason it was such a great game. It's next weekend so you better put on your calendar ahaha. Alright! Tell your mom I hope she gets better quickly. . Benjamin: I was unable to make it. Is that right. Who ended up winning? I wish I was free that night. I'm kind of mad that I didn't go. Yeah man thanks for asking, it's just that my mom is sick and I am taking care of her. She will, she just has a nasty flu but she will be alright. What was the score at the end of the game? Sounds like it was a close game then. I'll go to the next one for sure. Ahaha I will I will.

Cora: Have you heard how much fuss British media made about meet and greet with James Charles in Birmingham? Well, there was a meet and greet with James Charles in one of the malls in Birmingham and about 8000 fans showed up for it. It cause a gridlock around the mall and - of course - British media had to make some (quite negative) comments on it. Haha. You shouldn't watch so much youtube, you're getting weirder and weirder. ;) "Daily Mail" was surprised that a meet and greet with a "virtually unknown" youtuber gathered 8000 people. A host from LBC tried to find an answer to an unanswerable. Right? Some hosts from ITV Central couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that a guy can wear makeup. I agree! There are still plenty of dinosaurs in the media. . Ellie: No. . . ! What happened? They came for sister James? ! > I sister snapped! ! Sister shut up so, what did they say? There's something called google lol. Really? ? ? Smh it's 21st century, they should have noticed already. . . there are so many amazing male makeup artists. Question: "Who is James Charles? ". Eventually James called him and introduced himself. On air.
