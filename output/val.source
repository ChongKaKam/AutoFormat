A: Hi tom, are you busy tomorrow ’ s afternoon? Can you go with me to the animal shelter ?. I want to get a puppy for my son. Yeah, we ’ ve discussed it many times. I think he ’ s ready now. I'll get him one of those little dogs. And eat too much ). Oh, yes, i took him there last monday. He showed me one that he really liked. He wanted to take it home right away. He said he ’ d name it after his dead hamster – lemmy - he's a great motorhead fan. B: I ’ m pretty sure i am. What ’ s up? What do you want to do? That will make him so happy. That ’ s good. Raising a dog is a tough issue. Like having a baby. One that won't grow up too big. Do you know which one he would like? I bet you had to drag him away. I wonder what he'll name it.
Rob: I used to get one every year as a child! Loved them! Yeah, they can be fabric/ wooden, shop bought/ homemade, filled with various stuff. I like that! My sister adds notes asking her kids questions about christmas such as what did the 3 wise men bring? Etc. Lauren: They are different these days! Much more sophisticated! Haha! Small toys, christmas decorations, creative stuff, hair bands & clips, stickers, pencils & rubbers, small puzzles, sweets. I add one more very special thing as well- little notes asking my children to do something nice for someone else. I reckon it prepares them for christmas. My children get very excited every time they get one! Emma: I ’ ve just fallen in love with this advent calendar! Awesome! I wan na one for my kids! Yeah, i remember! They were filled with chocolates! What do you fit inside? Wow! That ’ s brill! X. And makes it more about traditions and being kind to other people. I can see why !
Jackie: Madison is pregnant. But she doesn't wan na talk about it. I don't know why because she doesn't wan na talk about it. I wanted to prepare you for it because people get super excited and ask lots of questions. And she looked way more anxious than excited. It could be money problems or relationship problems. It could be all of the above. Why? I felt similar way on patricia's wedding. Yes. What a coincidence. So she's pregnant? Damn ... Iggy: Why. Ok. She's probably worrying about it. She's taking every commitment really seriously. Or maybe she wants an abortion. But you know what? Once my friend was pregnant and i couldn't bring myself to be happy about it. I felt they were immature and i couldn't picture this couple as parents. Patricia stevens? So we're talking about the same person. She thought she was.
Marla:  Look what i found under my bed. It certainly isn't mine, my ass is big but it isn't huge. Ok but how can you leave your underwear after hooking up? Wtf is wrong with people.

Tamara: Is that someone's underwear? Not necessarily, maybe some butch had fun in your room while you were gone. Or maybe someone put their pants there to piss you off. Maybe it belonged to one of your exes? Lol. I think your sister convinced someone to put their underwear in your room as a dare.  Always happy to help. Kiki: Lol. It looks like male underwear. She or he could be too wasted to notice. If it's childish then it must have been your sister's idea. She would have recognized it.  Tamara, you just cracked the case!

I'm just looking for something a bit more niche. Is it one of those intentionally bad movies? Ok, thank you, i'll check it out. What ?: D. I've heard of sharknado and zombeavers sound just awesome. Thanks guys, you helped me a lot. Dennis: Toxic avenger for sure. There's troma studio for ya - toxic avenger, poultrygeist - the latter is exceptionally awful - and it's a musical. Most definitely. And when it comes to more recent movies there are those stupid animal-based horror movies like sharknado or zombeavers.

Maybe, but that's weird, it's just a fitness app. Martha: Yeah, everyday, you installed too? And? Hm, weird ... Did you have any notification? Eh, it happens in certain models, unfortunately.

Andrzej: I can not come today to your class, sorry about that. Could we make it some other day? I am truly sorry about that. I had some small accident, i cut my finger and now my stomach hurts. Yes, i understand, sorry one more time. It will not happen again, thank you for understanding. Magda: Andrzej, it's the third time you are skipping my class. I hope it's the last time. You're terrible at making excuses. Let it be your last time. Because every time you do that it ruins my whole schedule. I'm serious, it's the last time. Next time you will have to find another tutor.
Kate: No, i was just there a second ago. Have you tried calling him? I'm sorry . : / what do you need him for? Oh yeah, he mentioned that. He gave his notes to jenny - she's keeping them safe for you. By our place by the fountain? You bet! Robert: Hey, is mark by the office? I've been calling him all day but his phone's off. He isn't responding to his emails either : /. He was supposed to send me his notes on the faircase review. Great ! !! That's a relief! I'll swing by tomorrow fancy lunch as well? It's a date! See you tomorrow kate !

Yeahi'll show you. I just wanted to ask you, when you have a minute, i mean not now if you're busy. Could you just see how it looks on you mobile and tablet. It should be totally responsive and display on all devices.
Ken: Good wave ; ) you had there. Summer: Totally, let's do the same tomorrow ! Luke: So much fun today.
Diego: Last week. She'll stay in the hospital another few weeks. I think it's not that bad. But she needs to stay under observation. From what i understood all is under control. Marcel: I want to go on monday. Maybe she'll have to stay there until the end of her pregnancy. Carmen: How is martha? Has anyone visited her? Few more weeks, it doesn't sound good. So the baby is not in danger anymore. She's already 30 weeks pregnant. Maybe it's better that she stays under doctors ' control. In case something happens. But it must be tough to stay in the hospital bed all these weeks.
Essy: Send us the link to the gallery ! ! Jack: The wedding pictures are ready ?? Angela: 
Mary: Haha, we will drink it. Kate: Whose bottle of wine is it? At the kitchen table. Will: It's for my parents! Please don't! It's very expensive, for their anniversary.
Jannet: I'm open to any suggestions , 8pm sounds ok. How about having a before party? Only if you want to, they have special shoes at the bowling club. Camil: Ok guys, soi've made this group so that everyone can share their opinion about the bowling on friday. When it comes to hours, i suggest 8pm, the price is 5 $ per person. It's not the only option, we can also go at 9pm or even later. Before party is a. Don't worry, after party was also included in the. I guess it's all settled then, we're in touch, if you have any questions you can either text me or call me. Luna: Is 8pm the only option? I'm at work until 7:30 and it's possible i won't make it on time. Cool, theni'd opt for 9pm. So sad i won't be there : /. Happy to hear. Sure. Mick: Hey guys ! !! I'm totally in. Plan: P. That: D. Joseph: I'm of the same opinion as jannet. Do we need to take our shoes or something? Hm .... i guessi'll take mine afterall.  Yep: D. Must: D we can meet at my place at 7pm or something.
Harry: Hey, i'm going to ikea this evening. I remember you said that you wanted to buy some candles and other stuff. You wan na come with me? No problem! Is 18 ok? I want to buy a desk to my office room. Yeah. Ikea has got exact same desk as my architect put in the project, so it's super convenient. Seriously, i hate having too much to choose from. I have problems to decide then. Hahaha! Fuck you james :: P. James: Sure! Will you pick me up? Sure, i've just finished work andi'm coming home. I'll be ready by then. Btw, what do you need from ikea? Woah. Have you chosen it yet? No room for spontanous choice though. I get you man. My girlfriend has the same problem on sweets aisle in a supermarket.
Richard: Enjoy! Harry: Again ?! Jane: Let the holiday begin! Xxx. Get lost! X. Sunny turkey ; ). Victoria: Post some pics! X. Mary: Have a lovely time! Mark: Where're you going? I hate you! Jane : ; ).
Sally: Good morning prudence, how are you? Is everything all right? Indeed. This is awfully short notice prudence. I don't think i will be able to catch an earlier bus. I guess so. I'll hurry. See you then. Prudence: Good morning sally. I am fine, thank you. Yes, everything is fine. However, as you know, this is an important day for us. I will need you in at work earlier.

We have orders to deliver the parcels following the route. Your parcel is supposed to be the 6th. If you are not home, i will leave your parcel in the security office.
Rose:  No! Where'd you hear that? And do you know what it changes for us? And i guess that is a move that is supposed to make everything easier. Edd: Wow, did you hear that they're transferring us to a different department? Well, it's quite official. Anderson just told us. They won't change the professors. But i know the paperwork will get trickier. Yeah, guess so. They have a funny way of understanding'to make things easier '. Whaaaaat: O.
Trayson: My flight got cancelled.  Bad weather. Sudden storm. Waiting in line .. I will ttyl. Sara: What happened? That's insane. So unfortunate. Mike: No way !! Are you booking you for another flight?
Thea: What happened? Helga? What did she do? How dare she come to your house and criticise you like that. And speaking with the others in armenian, that's so impolite when she thinks you don't understand . Hollie: I'm all shaking. I'm so pissed. I almost blew at that fat pig. Nothing more than she normally does. It's been accumulating. She came to dinner and started criticising what i cooked. She thinks i don't understand armenian.
Daniel:  Btw, i got the results back from the blood tests i did. Well, i managed to reach the clinic on the phone .. and everything is ok and normal ann-.

It's gr8 !
Sheryl: Should we visit ann in the hospital? I'll write her right now. She asked me not to come. Me too . Jeff: It would be a nice gesture but i would ask her first. She may not want to be seen in this state. Ok, let me know. Sad, but i understand it.

Fanny: Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. I think i might have messed up the project. At this point? It's criminal bad. I hope they only fire me. I asked everyone. Even brad saidi'm screwed. Do you think it's a good idea? Ok. let me know . Zed: Fanny, what happened? Tell me, please, i'm getting really worried. Fanny, that's not saying anything. Shit. How bad is it? Calm down, i'm sure there's a way out. Do you want me to call michael? I don't know, can it get any worse? Worth a try, i guess?
Ella: Oh come on ... I guess ... Sophia: Missed the tram ... Waiting for the next one i guess.
Jenny: How silly, they think they will escape the problems this way? Anyway, nkurunziza promised it in 2007, didn't he? Do they have any city planning project for gitega? To avoid being toppled by some city unrests in bujumbura. There he will have more control over space. Abdi: Seems so. It's 20 or so times smaller than bujumbura. But it will take some time. Kirk: So they've just decided to move the capital. And the costs it will generate. They say about 3 years. He did. I think something similar was made in birma at some point by the regime there. To just avoid protests and clashes. I've no idea. At least partially. Marvin: I've never been to gitega, seems a. Exactly. So you think it's for political reasons? Shithole: P.
Baldwin: No way, do they have more in stock? Thanks, first i need to measure if it would fit on my tv cabinet. Arnold: Look whati'm buying for black friday. There were 2 left, i will send you a photo with the shop's location. Here you go, be quick about it. Evelyn: I've always wanted some of those curved tvs.
Kyle: He's from slovenia. We talked many times about slovenia and his home town. Bled i think, close to the alps. Jenny: Eastern europe i believe. Jack: Really? I was sure he was polish. And why do you find slovenia cute? Hahaha. True, quite exotic. Mike: Do you know where tomas is from? Sure, but what country exactly. I heard him speaking english today with kamil, so i think he's not polish. Oh, how cute, how do you know? Which is? I think he's the only slovenian in the company now.
William: Hi! What happened? I see. I ’ ll drop by after work and take a look. I love you too . Mia: Hi dad! I need a hand with repairing the bathroom door. Nothing. I can ’ t open/close it properly. It ’ s sort of sagging .. Thank you so much! Love you!
Alexander: I ate so much, i can not move. Harold: Hahaha. Me too. Merry christmas.
Jessy: Did you know that caroline got herself a new car? Yes. Dark blue toyota. I remember her talking about changing her old mitsubishi but didn't know she already made that move. Yeah. I was thinking about it too. But this time i think i would want an suv. They have much more space. I was thinking about infinity or toyota too. But it definitely is not gon na be a new one. Is way too much money for a new one. Clara: Yeah. I have seen it the other day but i thought it was a loaner. A navy blue right? Yeah. That's the one i saw. It looks brand new. I guess so. Maybe is time we trade in our old friend too. Do you have any specific brand in mind? Those are nice cars. Maybe we should start looking around. I agree .
Hallie:  I found also another website. With some basic info.  Ok clara :. Clara: It's ok. Bltn. For sure. That topic is all greek to me .... And i can see that on this page ev is clearly described. Thx. I'll check it later. Cause nowi'm sitting at work : < < <. Emma: Girls. I forgot to send you that link.  Sorry that it took so long !! Hope you'll find it useful!
Lorenzo: I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer mma but the buzz about this fight made me watch it. And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time conor lost much of his stamina. You better watch your mouth pablo cause if conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xd. But you know, mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in mma 3 rounds is the limit. So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules ?? Good old pablo ... i love your temperament you son of a bitch. Luigi: Geez, mayweather totally destroyed mcgregor! Did you watch gentlemen ?? Hahaha. You follow ufc events and you know mcgregor's a freak and likes to provoke people. He was, actually i was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds. Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the irishman was attacking again an again. But you know, floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for conor to get tired and you know the rest. No doubt about it, bro. Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows. Lol xd. Pablo: Whatta hell are you two talking about ?? Mcgregor and boxing ?? He's an mma warrior, those r 2 different worlds! Wtf. And mayweather ?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight! Aight but those r people from mma that he provokes, not from fuckin boxing! He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard. Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense. But anyway ... mayweather won, you've said that. And mcgregor? Was he sharp? Experience bitch, he beat'the notorious ' thanks to his fuckin experience! True. Duuuuuude. Conor would destroy him, no doubt. Hope so, i'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am. Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that. Pablito: D.
Emily: Hi, so what do u think about the change of eng teachers? I think they didn't want us 2 panic during our holidays. The school was closed 4 2wks so no one would be available to deal with our qs & concerns. Andi'm sure the new teacher is highly qualified. Oh, i didn't know that. So she will teach our kids a true & correct accent. Jenny is also happy. She says that the classes are very fun & interesting . Sophie: Hi, well i must admit that i was quite surprised. I don't really understand why we weren't informed b4 march break. You might be right. Yeah, she has an ma in education & she's a native canadian speaker. Annie seems to already like her.
Joan: No, no yet, stop pushing me! Sorry, sorry, i'm just too nervous . Tim: Ready? I'm just asking, calm down!
Rachel: Why 2? Lol. The lecture is at 5pm. I think it's pointless to be there 3 hours earlier. We can just take a public bus at about 4. Monica: Should we take the shuttle bus at 2? To avoid being late? Hmm, too early? So what? The next shuttle is at 5.30. Ok, as you prefer !
James: Same as always. We're starting at 2pm. We have a new expansion for isle of skye. That should take around 90 min. We can choose the other game later. Np. Bella: What's the plan for sunday? What are we playing? Alright. Thanks for the info.
Ellie: In your bag i thought. Wanda: Have you seen my keys. Not here. Got them ... in my bag ...
Rob: Hi sue can you work today? Jane has fallen ill .... Yes. Its getting to be a bit of a habit on a tuesday. I'm not sure but she needs to pick her ideas up or she will need another job ! Sue: Yes no prob, whats wrong? Again? Do you think she has another job?
Patrick: Thanks! She said yes, i'm over the moon! Colin: Duude, congrats! Lucky guy.
Mia: Yes, i'm leaving in 5 min. You did! Sam: Hi. Are you home? Good. Could you check if i unplugged the iron in my room? Phew. Thanks !
Roseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen. I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but i hate it when it's dirty. I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so i clean regularly. But i love it when all my stuff just lies around. When i put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, i keep on getting mad that i have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach. Hey, i never said i can come. My hubby's away this weekend, so i have no one to leave the kids with ; (. But are you serious or just mad at us? Lol, okay. Actually, i think that when i tell them to go and help aunt meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun. Exactly. But bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job. Well, sometimes. But still i think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way? The famous chocolate cookies? Guys, i thinki'm gon na change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper ?: D. Megan: No, sorry, i'm cleaning the house today. Remind me to never stay at your. Just reading this gives me the creeps. You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, roseanne. Just bring them over. No, i'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if i ask them to do something, they actually do. Tell them i can pay with cookies if they help me. Why not? I'm feeling generous. You're always welcome! But sorry boys, it's going to be a “ girls only ” event ( except for little billy ). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned. Clean: D. Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink? I don't get why it matters so much whether i clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust. I prefer the floor. There's more space on. Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a. Do they pay him ?: P. Today: D. D. Beer: D. It: D. D. Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though i was the one in charge when our parents were away. What's the difference? There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? Xd. Take them to megan's place, they can help her. And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster ?: D. Place: P.
John: Hey. Tell mom i wont be able to attend because of work. Im sorry, its work. I hope so. Jane: Poor mom, and the way she was waiting for you. Cool, im sure she will understand. She will.
Olivia: Tacos and barritos. All is ready dear ! ! Sophie: Whats for dinner mom? Wowwww! My favourite please keep it ready will be home in 20 mins.
Stefy: How is you new home - sweet home? Have you finish to open all your boxes? I'll be happy to give you a hand, buti'm a bit far away ... Is it bigger than your previous flat? Good opportunity to sort out. Enjoy the garden!  You and me next month. You won't need them? Invite them for tea. You should move away ... Keep hope, and think about next month. Sun, sea, and martini .... You: No sun and neighbours a bit too close. Lena: Home but sweet? I'm not sure! There is still a full bunch of them in the yard. Kids help me. It's a house, so it's seem bigger, but there is no built-in closets. For sure. But nowi'd like to have a rest. I'm fed up. Full south and a big tree in the middle hiding the sun all day. Do you believe it? Yes, a real garden with only flowers and no trees. Remind me to bring the deckchairs. I told. No way, they're too old and very noisy. I hope they stop making noise at night. It was a mistake to choose this house. But there were no choice.
Lilly: Hey jamie how have you been? Pretty good, me and my husband just got back from vacation we went to mexico for the summer it was amazing! What have you been up to lately? Thats so nice to here! Well the reason i was sending you a message was to see if you like to have lunch sometime this week and check up. Theres this amazing new italian place in queens iv been dying to try. Ahh my girls have dance at 1 and i hate to rush. Yes money would work great with me! I know it feels like a life time haha! See you monday! Jamie: Im great! Its been so long how are you ? ''.

Sonja: I can't believe they ejected him from the game. C'mon! That kind happens all the time in hockey ! Elisabeth: That was a dirty hit!
Freddie: Jim's repairs, it's on freedom street. Ye, but he rarely picks up because he has lots of shit to do - 554 645 387. You bet you do ; ). Bob: What was the name of that car mechanic you told me yesterday ?? Does he have a phone number >. Thanks mate, owe you one.
Sandra: Hey, are you busy this friday? Don't laugh at me, but one of my new year resolutions is to learn horse riding. What do you think? Well, it can be, yes, but i don't think it's much more dangerous than driving a car. Accidents happen everywhere. I get your point, i was thinking about it as well. A bit, yes, but i always wanted to learn horse riding, so i thought that as soon as it isn't anything that requires me to, i don't know, go abroad or a lot of money, i may at least give it a try. I know < 3 pity though as i wanted you to join me : > ... I booked a slot on friday afternoon after work. So far i booked only one, but i know there some slots left. Sooo ... do you want to join me? We should be there around 5.30, the lesson starts at 6. Come on, ov. You know, it'd be so much more fun if we go together. Scared: D. Olivia: Hi, no, not really, why? Wow! Are you serious? Hm, not sure. It sounds really cool, but isn't it dangerous? And? Aren't you afraid? Makes sense. I'm just worried ; ). Me ?! What time exactly? Hm ... it does sound tempting, buti'm. I feeli'm going to regret it, but. Ok: P how much is it? Sandra : 20 quid per hour, you spend there always more around two, but pay only for the riding part .
Laura: Really thats amazing, keep some for me. Kisses: Sam :: Kisses :. Sam: I just baked a cake, its delicious. Offcourse honey just tasted it, we will eat together laura ::.
Violet: Have a safe flight! Rose: I'm going to the airport. Thanks! See you in a few days .
Rosie: I think i forgot my pen at your place yesterday. No, mine is blue. That might be gretchen's. She might also be looking for it. No, you can give me tomorrow at college. Waiting for you then . Harrison: Which pen actually is it. Green one? Her is a bit far so can't go to her's. Would be outside your home to give you yours. It's totally okay. I would be passing nearby. So i won't have any problem.
Christian: Hi isabel, thank you for your message, please tell me what kind of information do you need. No problem, i will send you photos of our passports this afternoon. I think you're right ... ok, let me just ask my friends and i will let you know this afternoon. Is it ok? Thank you isabel! How much time do we need to get to the apartment? We will have to wait for the luggage and get to the station but i really hope we arrive to the center around 22:00 ... That's great, i will text you when we are at anton martin. Thank you, we will let you know. Isabel: Hello, my name is isabel, i have received your reservation. I'd like to confirm the details. Please send me a message whenever you are able to confirm your arrival. First of all, i need full names of all guests. And your passport of id numbers. I mean the document you are travelling with. Thank you. Full names and numbers will be enough for me, i don't think it's safe to send such dcuments by whatsapp. Yes, of course. What time are you arriving in madrid? Christian : 21:20 at barajas airport. Please let me know when you arrive. The best way to get to the apartment is to take the metro line 8 to the center, then change to line 10 at nuevos ministerios, and then line 1 at tribunal. Your station is antón martin. You can call me if you need help. I think that about 30 minutes. No problem, i will be waiting for you with the keys, i live next door. Door 14. Please tell me how many towels do you need. I will prepare 4 towels in the apartment but you can tell me if you need more.
Arthur: Did you pay the gas bill. Well think harder. Cuz the tech just came in. And wants to turn off the gas. Thanks. Sorry panicked ! Linda: Yeah i think so. Gees! Finei'll check.  There. The confirmation form the bank. Your welcome you ass!
Max: So it seems like we're finally getting ourselves a car. Oh, a toyota. It'll be sooo much more convenient now. Our place isn't really that easy to reach by public transport, there's only one bus and it's like the timetable doesn't exist so you often end up waiting at the stop for ages. Yeah, sadly ... but whatever. Now we won't have to rely on them any more, woohoo! She was against it at first but i knew she had to give in eventually. I mean, it'll benefit all of us, after all. Yeah, i'm trying to convince her to get a licence, too. I don't want her to feel likei'm only doing this for myself. It would be better if both of us could drive . George: Whoa, for real? Sweet, i know you've wanted one for a while. What make? Oh man, i remember it used to be like this. I thought things might've changed since the times i used to take the bus to visit you, but i guess not? Must have been hard to convince sylvia, no? Man, you'll be so happy, i'm sure. I know i don't regret it. Nothing beats the comfort and freedom, really.
Mariah: Again? What network? Is she going to bet that we can see russia from alaska again? Xd. Apparently mccain regretted nominating her as. The republican candidate for vice president. They scoured america for that lady. I think she is. She better not move from there. She is the only one in the family that has a political problem with anybody. K i am watching her. She hasn't changed a bit! Sarah: Sarah palin is on tv. Nbc. Hahaha she is a joke. I didn't know that! Is she still in alaska? I mean her family is quite nice. They appeared on some shows. She actually looks good. I agree !

Madeleine: He did it again! Ross! His leg is broken, again! Yes, i ’ m in the hospital right now, we need to wait for some paper work to be finished. No, i took a car, but it would be great if you tried cooking some dinner, i didn ’ t have time because all this fuss. We have only froze vegetables and some chicken. Great, thank you . Maxwell: Who, what, what happened. How did it happen, is he alright? Do you want me to pick you up? Okay baby, i will figure something out. No problem, i ’ m an expert in doing great dishes out from nothing ; ].
Martial: Let me recharge first then i call him. Ok. Kendy: Call kevin. Ok, but hurry up its kinda urgent the way he sounded.
Galvin: Listen btw, do you think i should send them all an email? You know becausei'm leaving. Yeah, i mean they were here for dinner, they could have told me something then. Yes that's a good idea. I don't want to make a big deal out of it.  Thanks for your support. Manuel: Hmm .. To be honest i don't think it's necessary. Exactly. Maybe you could just say bye individually. Yeah. There is no need to. I really don't want you to go though.  But i know that you will be fine. I know that you will be happier somewhere else. Anytime.

Meki: No, they are playing right now. Rada is the best, then radmila and at the end is gorjana. Canasta game. No, i do not like to play cards. For me, playing a cards is rather losing i nice time. It is better to read something actual rom news papers or from some internet blogs. Good bye, i love you. Veki: Are they finished their job? Who is the better? Which game they are playing? Do you know to play a canasta? Why? Hm. You are right. I love you too. Good bye .

I will bring in donuts for the office tomorrow! Hahaha quite true, although this time the police woman had quite a bit to say as well ... Well and with my wages we might have to put up with cheap biscuits ... That's a shame karen, i was hinting at a pay rise! That's ok, more donuts for us ... True. Cheap biscuits andi'll make a round of drinks then? Have a good evening all, see you tomorrow! Sue: Nice !! Just invoice the social workers, it's generally their fault meetings overrun! Me too! Can i remind you i am in this chat group? And who would deal with the repairs department wheni'm gone? You wan na think this through a bit better! Lovely! Karen: Who left all the coffee cups out in the kitchen? Well, you know what to do ! !! No hope getting donuts out of either of those budgets though ... I'll take cheap biscuits !! That's fine with me, the only thing is, we'd have to let sue go ... She has got a point. Perfect! You too !

Lol, i don't think he'd get the wrong idea if you were upfront about it. Just tell him you're having trouble and need help. Period. Nothing more. Don't do that! You just need a bit of help. That's a great idea ! !! Good luck ! Erica: That paul is a smart guy, isn't he? I'm having trouble in calculus 101, i wonder if he could tutor me. I don't want to give him the wrong idea, though. I don't want him to think i want to date or anything lol. I know !! The only thing i want from him is to learn what derivatives are lol xd. Mmmi'm too shy to ask him to tutor me. Maybei'll just ask the professor for extra credit. You know what, i'll start a study group. Yes, it's better than asking a practical stranger to tutor me. I'll ask around in class to see if anyone is interested in joining the group.
Gary: Hi i just wanted to thank you for the party last night. How do you mange to get everyone there without me knowing. Well yes but i was thinking about doing something the same for marjory in the spring it is her 70th. Yes that has been booked for a while but a little surprise party with family and friends would be sweet dont you think? You may have a good point. How would we go about getting everyone there. It would depend on the weahther tho lucy. Yes please will you do that for me. Her birthday is the 9th april and we go away on the 15th. Yes if you can top what you did for me last night. Uh huh lol.

Yes that would be nice, i thought you were taking her away? Do you know what .. the rococo gardens are open in the spring and they have a lovely tea room that can be hired out, we can get everyone together for an afternoon tea, you know marjory doesn't like a drunken mess lol. Think about it. We could get a little coach from town and then you could drive over half hour later for a little spring walk, pop into the tea rooms and we will all be there with tea and cakes. Yes, she wouldn't get in the car if it was raining, no we need something like that but indoors .. what about if i look around? Of course .. when do you go away and when is her birthday? Ok i will see what is around and let you know, we will find something really memorable for her. You liked the elvis theme then? Your funny. Well thats all we could hope for xx.

U shouldn't have gotten on that motor bike with your friend. U should know its dangerous. U should have known. I get that alot actually. Well at least i made u laugh.
Harry:  That feeling, when you wash your car by yourself working your ass off half of a day. You feel satisfaction looking at your shining beauty. And then a group of birds having their fucking convention on electrical cable above, decide to shit on your freshly washed car. Ruthless fuckers. I feel like shooting them, but i know i would feel totally bad hurting even one of these animals. Hahaha . There: D. Sadist: D nice combo. Pete: Hahahha. Congrats mate. Don't worry. When my father washes his car, evertime he's done with it, it starts raining. The birds though .... coid blooded fuckers. Sympathetic.
Ronald: Yeah? Huh. That's new to me too, my pc is enough for me so i haven't really looked into it, i guess? Won't that cause some lag tho? I mean, if it's just streaming and you use the old laptop's keyboard and mouse, i guess it still needs to communicate with the other computer. I wonder how well that works. Phillip: Huh, i've just learned something interesting. I got the new laptop cuz my old one couldn't run the newer games. Andi'm downloading something on steam now. But i had no idea you didn't have to install games on all computers at home. Turns out you've only got ta download them once and you can just stream them in the same network. Yeah and apparently this means i could play on my old laptop now too. Because it would be using the new one's resources. Yeah, i probably won't be doing that because there isn't much point, i just thought it was interesting.

I have 3 options, but this is my favourite and i can easily afford it. Eveline: It's really nice, how much is it? Cause i don't see any price marianne : 100 $.

Yours? I figured. What have you been up to? Oh how's things going with martha ?: D. Ah wan na talk about it? Yeah, i've recently been hooked on this show called `` designated survivor '' - it's really good! Well basically in america when congress meets, there's always one person who doesn't attend in case of a terrorist attack ( they're the `` designated survivor '' ). So basically in the show, this guy ( played by kiefer sutherland ) becomes president after an attack, except that he doesn't want to be president. It's pretty good. No idea, haven't seen it.

She was doing history with me last year. But we weren't close. Pretty girl, quite shy. Rarely talked to anyone. I don't know. I don't think she escaped. I heard she had good contact with her family, they all loved each other.

Or relying on public transport? We? Are you again with your `` travelling companion ''? Sure not. So happy trails to you! Soph: Hello tonny, greetings from mexico! Am on a 5-week drive thru ' the yucatan peninsula and enjoying it immensely.  Started in cancun, staying in town but visited the peninsula and isla mujeres, and now have come to merida for 10 days or so. Then planning to visit valladolid, campeche and maybe izamal and some other places. Nothing definite yet. We've rented a car. Not too expensive in mexico. I wouldn't have dared to come here alone! Thanks. Love. Sophie.

Getting up in the ranks? Like what? And what do u do there? Doesn't sound like something 4 me. Well, i don't like rpgs. Maybe 4 u . Vic: Don't like such games. What's the fun in flying a plane? Still, all the same. U just fly and shoot. Boring. The same with racing games. All u do is drive. Where's the fun in that? Nah. Prefer games where u actually have to do something. For example - assassin's creed rebellion. Tons of stuff! U can build ur castle, develop it, battle templars and get unique characters. Y? Bt they're a lot of fun!
Meg: Good good. Thanks, i have half of it done already but if i am behind next weeki'll let you know ok?  Thanks < 3. Jamie: How are you doing with the translation? Need help? Sure.

But jude, i mean it - if you need me, i'll be there in a flash.
Mattie: Will you call me when dad is at home? Ty : *. Ross: Sure.
Olivier: Well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings. Oliver: I think i should stop reading the rules after we already played a game. Found two things we were doing wrong today. First the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one ( so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong. And second, you only get the income for the resources you own ( tokens on top ) and not for everything you have access to. Well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again. With the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that. Additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote. So no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income. As usuali'm up for anything. But if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules. First: P. Emily: The second rule means money would be much more sparse. True. Yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ; ). We can always do it during the next meeting. Chris: Maybe it shows that you should keep reading them. So what we were doing wrong? The map had full symbol drawn for the action so i also thought it was permanent influence. Had no idea about the second one. Makes sense. Buti'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import. Right. Well just like emily said we need to play this again. Rule: P ).
Misha: Have you bought from this website?  I want to buy this dress.  It looks great. Buti'm not sure about the quality ... Indeed thanks : *. Kamil: No ... it looks like a chinese website. I wouldn't expect too much ... Pedro: I've never heard of it. Why don't you check opinions on yt?  Look at that. It looks like a review of your dress.
Amanda: Oh no, my phone charger has stopped working. Dunno, it just won't charge. But i have an iphone and she has a samsung. Oh, i could do that, yeah. Should i get the spare part from apple or ...? Uhh ... alright, i guess checking what's wrong comes first. Yeah, i'll brb. Back. And it's still not charging. Or ?? There's another possibility? I'm a bit worried now but ok. Thanks, i'll do that ... i hope it'll work, not sure if i can afford a repair : /. Keith: The cable or the charger itself? Can't you ask your sister to lend you hers? Hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. So if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works? Then at least you'll know which part needs replacing. Idk, i've never had an iphone. I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work ... their prices are too high. Can you do it now? K. Then it must be the cable. Or ... Well, i guess there might be sth wrong with the charging port but that's the worst case scenario. So let's not think about it yet? I've found some shop that sells replacement cables.  I'd try this one first, see if the phone detects the cable at all. Cuz if it does, then problem solved, if it doesn't ... then it might be the port. But it's cheap enough to give it a try.
Mateo: Duuude pick up ur phone or open the door. I just need something. No it can not > >. Jesse: Its 5am in the morning theres a reason i did not answer the phone -. Im sure it can wait. Go to hell let me sleep.

Michelle: My boss just accepted the holiday! July 8th-19th. Are u still fine with croatia? What do u think about this travel agency?  Great! Let's take the 14 day option. Make the most of it. I'm just debating between the direct flight and the layover in budapest. Ok, u convinced me! Thank you love ! < 3. I'll take care of the currency exchange. Alex: Great news. Ok, so now that we have that taken care of, let's find an offer. Yup, it was amazing last time, so let's go back and explore more. Oh, i'm way ahead of u, i already chose some options.  Let's fly directly. I mean i know it's more expensive, but we saved up all year. We'll have more time to ourselves in croatia on the beach. I'll book this offer and wire the money. No problem my dear, we deserve a break! Alex : 14 days in paradise with u michelle : < 3 see u at home !

Jackie: Hi love, you ok? I know what you mean, the store was madness today, lots of difficult customers! Well, hope so. Just chilling out with a bit of apprentice on iplayer. Ooh, it's excellent this time, lots of bitching, backstabbing and foolish choices, cringy puns too! Yeah, good idea! I mean, why did they think that jetpop would be a good name for an airline, complete with exploding icon for the o in pop! Yes, they did indeed! Then there was the one when they decided that siracha hot sauce was a good idea on top of doughnuts! Better get back to it, anyway! Don't overdo it, love! Pop into the shop on the weekend to say hi. Bye ! Serena: Yep, college was full on, then i had work, absolutely knackered now! I'm sure you handled it well, babes! Haven't watched it this year, what are the idiots up to? Sounds great, might look it up for a laugh! They never did! I bet they lost! Oh my god, i've got to see that, it sounds bloody terrible! Will do! I need some new jeans anyway. Bye love!

Odin: Yeah, you? Reyna: Have zain invited you in his party? Yes.

Ann: Yep. Gr8. Ethan: You ready to go? Ok, let's meet next to the bus station, i'll come for you. I will be there within 10min so at you house danny within 20-25min. Danny: Ok.
Fran: So how's the new affair going ? ; ). What happened? There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time. Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it. You don't have to understand anything. You probably started thinking too much ; ). You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wan na rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ; ). Well it went away so maybe it will come. You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once. Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do not force yourself into anything. Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ; ). Back: D you can't overthink those things. They don't like it ; ). Sally: Hmm. I'm not sure. I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. Maybe there's something wrong with me. It's not like i wan na give up but sometimes i wonder if i should be forcing myself. I just don't understand it. And myself. I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now i really don't know what happened and how to get it back. Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy. I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean i can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all. I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and i feel much better after the talk. Yeah i would but i know i can't have it all. I'm not going to. I guessi've been lucky i found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things. You're probably right .
Sia: Ask. What will you wear? So maybe classic smoky? Smoky with colour accent? Hmm, maybe. Have you done any before? So maybe something easier? You don't want to screw anything, right? So maybe spotlight? Just blend a few shades of brown and put some metallic shadow in the middle. You have green eyes, so maybe purple? No problem, just remember about blending ! Lizzy: Can i ask you something? I'm going out with marco and his friends. We will be in a club. And i need a make up inspiration. Black dress. Boring. I was thinking about half cut crease. No .. You're right. Which colour do you suggest? Okay ^^. Thank you : *.
Betty: Fine. And you? Not today. I'm still working. Maybe tomorrow? I see. I'm free on saturday evening. Great ! Michael: Hi, how are you doing? Good.

Ashley: Omg, did u hear that karen is on sick leave ... : /. Yeah & i'm stuck giving the presentation on my own again. But u know, she'll take credit 4 it, when she returns. Brianna: Are you joking ?: O again? It's like the 4th time in 3 mths. No way, it's so obvious she's faking it ... You should really talk 2 leanne about this, it's totally unfair .
Royce: Good night, love you. Mario: Hey, goodnight. Love you too.

We had a few months off during summer, our summer, but now bookings start flowing in. Well ... are you planning to visit us? You two are always welcome! Perfect!

As i say we've been receiving bookings daily now. Will you be coming with tino, if i may ask? Great ! 4th till 12th? Take care ! Beryl: Hello guys! How are you doing? We've lost contact for a few months now. Hope you are well. I'm very well indeed. Thank you. Any changes in your setup? Are you still running your lovely airbnb? You caught me here. I'm vaguely considering going down to onrus again, most likely in january. What does it look like with vacancies then? Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you? Not so much. Can i get back to you in 2 , 3 days ' time? Well, no big deal. I'll be staying in cape town for a longer time and am quite flexible in my dates. No. I am single again. Hurray! So pls make it single occupancy any week in january, anton. Very good. I'll call you beforehand from cape town. Greetings to you both!
Kate: Remember the fortune-teller i told you about? I went to see her.  It was weird. You know i thought that she may be a crook, but i wanted to try anyway. Hahaha no, we just talked for the most part. She asked me why i decided to come, etc. She's a fortune-teller not a. She apparently doesn't see things in the future like ... she's watching a film, but in more ... symbolic way. She said she saw shoes, a door, a pair of big men's shoes and one pair of one shoes. Don't you get it? I'll meet someone and will have a kid! No, she's not supposed. Laugh all you want, but i think she's legit, you'll see. Frank: And are you now afraid to leave your own house? Isn't she supposed to know stuff like that? Shoes? Aren't you misinterpreting things? How much did you pay her? Kate : 60 frank : 60 quid just to hear that she sees shoes! Wizard: P. No: P. Claire: Wow, exciting! How was it? Was it like in the films? She knew your name and everything about you when you walked in? What did she tell you? Not really. Did she tell you that it was what it meant?
Hugo: I do, why. Again -. Yea, smoking weed and fuckin girls, that ’ s what you do. And you never visit her! Ok but this is the last time. Max: You have notes from the last lecture.

Harry: Nothing much buddy. How ’ s everything with you? Wow, that ’ s amazing buddy. I missed it. Why, what happened? And? And? Hahaha hahaha. Mark: Hey dude, what ’ s up? All good. Yesterday i went to a 7-star hotel restaurant. It ’ s not amazing. When i was there, i really needed to pass gas. The music was really loud, so i did it. I realized i was listening to my ipod.
Gina: Omg i am soooo hungover ! !! Hahaha. I'm going for pizza. Right ? ?? Emily :. Emily: Me to ... i haven't been able to get out of bed yet. And i ordered from mcdelivery. Totally worth it, though.
Iris: Hi, tell me what will nice as a present for flo? Perfume or something else? And for you all? Any ideas? I'm still in town for 2 days? Thank. I'll go shopping tomorrow. And for the others? Of course, but any useful gadget? And for mum? What about a small coffee machine like nespresso? There's some not so expensive. Was it some polish honey? And what is a brook saddle ? ? ?? Some specific design for his humble bottom? And for you? I'm thinking about it. Venaison and smoke salmon. Didn't he use his mobile as a clock? Lol. Oki'll try to have a look . Question: What have you planned for meals? Diana: I think the nina ricci pink apple. I'll confirm to you wheni'm back home. Nothing, just a good time spend all together. No ideas. She'll tell us that she needs nothing. Good idea. I love very much the honey with sesame seeds, if you find some ... and a brook saddle for his raleigh. Its a very nice brand for saddle, english and expensive - for your brother in law. I don't know !! And for you? Practical. Fine, i can bring foie gras and oysters. A small travel clock for ted.

Anton: Hey, need you to come back to the office. Eve ... Actually ... i was going to say that i agree with you ; d. Yeah ... i'm sorry about that. You were right - she is being unfairly biased against you. Honestly, i think you should report this. Nooo ... but that paired up with all the other examples and witnesses like me or frank, then we might have a solid case on our hands look, it's worth a shot eve : * sigh *. She didn't say : / but i can always try to get you out of there if things get rough. Hey, we're partners and you've risked your neck enough times for me, it's time to return the favour ; ). D see you in a bit! See you ; ). Eve: What ?! It's my day off ! ! ! >. I swear everyt single bloody time i have a free day, something likes this comes up >. Charlotte bloody fucking briggs. Oh shut up trakas - you know as well as i do that she's only doing this to spite me. It's probably going to turn out to be a paper that needs filing that could have waited till monday ... Or the janitor forgot his keys again and needs someone to let him in. Or what was it last time? She needed me to come in to discuss my project, which * again * could have waited. Wait - you do ?? I thought you were going to say that it's in my head like ast time ... And say what? Oh by the way, my boss made me come on saturday for a coffee run - does that count as office harrassment? If you say so ... honestly, i'm not convinced. So what does miss glorious want with me now? My hero * swoon *. Buti'm not sure i like the idea of you getting in the crossfires. Thanks.

I don't get it, they should know how to make politics. I really loved your place, it's so calm and so beautiful. That's exactly my point! Haha really ?! Maybe it's not such a bad idea xd. If they come, there'll be more people, more needs, more places to work… let's think positive! I know, but you must start with something ; ).

Patricia: Barry !! Have you heard the news? They released a demo gameplay from cyberpunk 2077! I know, right! I loved wild hunt but this is like a completely different level? Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. I can't wait !! You don't like first-person? Huh ... i actually haven't played first-person much, but i ended up really enjoying it in morrowind. It felt really immersive and when i switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange. I wouldn't really count on that. They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100 %. I just wish they'd tell us the release date already! Barry: What, really? Where did you see that? Patricia : < file. Holy shit, that's pretty impressive ... i was pumped for the game already but now this is hype. Whoa. It really is. I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the npcs seemed like real people, even the crowds. They said they'd be working on that and nowi'm sold. It's only a shame about the pov ... Well, i guess it's okay at times buti'd prefer over-the-shoulder. They say you can customise everything about your character soi'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point. Well, i'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person ... I'm still not sure buty'know, not gon na hate until it's actually release. It looks really good so far soi'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the pov. Hmm, who knows ... i think it was supposed to be ready this year, soi'm keeping my fingers crossed .

I had my doctor's appointment at 9 am. I have been feeling some weird stomach pain for the last couple of days. Didn't want to worry you. It was not that bad. I have been able to do everything, is just that i was feeling pretty weird. And i could not really at anything. He said that is probably some indigestion as i don't have any other symptoms. No fever, vomitting or anything. He gave me some herbs mix and if that does not help me told me to come back and they will do an ultrasound. No, not yet. I have been to a couple of pharmacies but they did not have it. No. I haven't been there. Will stop by there in the afternoon. Thanks. I will let you know. And i really appreciate your care.

Lucky: P that's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people? Stuff: D. Dear: P what have you been up to ? ; ) i'm not that sleepy, even though i did get to bed. Late: P. Cool: D i have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you. Ella: Thanks matty !! Merry christmas to you too ; ) how are you ? ? ?: D. Oh. Uni's hard work ( no changes there ), but i really like my subjects this semester - on of my subjects is microbiology ( so all on bacteria ), another is on the biochemical pathways to metabolic illnesses ( basically diabetes and obesity ) - so, pretty cool. What about you? Are you having fun? Did you take any photos whilst on your walk ?: D so ... what does your dissertation stuff look like? Are you in any uni groups? We don't really have dissertations ... at the end of my third yeari'll be writing my degree, so that will be like a slightly longer lab report geography and politics - hmmm ... that's a pretty wide topic, i mean, you could talk about global warming etc. Right? Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree social and cultural stuff ... like what? I meant grades from exams, so i don't know ifi'm really that. Depends on your field of study - i'm doing embriology, so i basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing microbiology, or study particular fragments of dna if they're doing genetics. It really depends on what you're studying - biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall. Matty: Happy christmas ! !: D hope you're enjoying the festivities. I'm good thank you just sleepy haha how about you? How's things going with studying. Sounds interestingi've got ta say. Particularly the bacteria stuff! I've been on a walk today so quite tired from that. Andi'm enjoying uni yeah! Very very busy. Starting dissertation stuff soon and had a lot of work for essays. Got some yeah posted one to facebook. Mine is looking like geography and politics related. Not sure about uni groups? What's your dissertation on if you have to do one? Aah ok. so the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it? And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there. Aaah. And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people. Oh right haha. And i have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And i likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab?
Andrew: Seen this. Yup. Wonna buy? Scott: Is it matt's moto? Wants to sell it? Dreaming of it. Have no cash .

It is warm outside, there is no sign that would indicate any change in weather conditions so .... think guys. Ivor: Yep, to be exact, it is here -. Isn't it the club where you met this nataly? Ok there was no question asked. Let's just post on our grup with the plan that is ready. Otherwise we won't go anywere today. Warner: We were thinking of this club near the central bus station. Interesting .... let me think. So what is your suggestion? So maybe lets ask the rest of the crew if they have any propositions.
Ramsay: Well, there's home alone. The lethal weapon films all had christmas in them! How about national lampoon's christmas vacation? That's my favorite! Nightmare before christmas? Or is that halloween? True. There are some newer ones, with tim allen as santa. What are they called? Yes, i forget how many. Well, all the old rankin bass stop motion ones like rudolph the red nosed reindeer and the year without a santa claus. I kind of like them myself! Nostalgia and all that! I'm sure there are newer ones, i just don't know them. Now you're getting too modern for me! Enjoy ! Julie: Can you give me some ideas for christmas movies, please? Oh, right! Not exactly what i mean, but ... Good one! It's both, i think! Oh, the santa clause films, right, i think there are three or four? This is a good start. More than we need probably. Any others? Those are great for the kids, right? Lol! I think so too. Christmas with the kranks, i think, was the chick from the halloween films? Okay, thanks for the advice!
Paul: That's johnson in accounts? His mum? About 100 then, please. When is that service, do you know? Okay, will probably do the visitation. See if anyone wants to come along. Have them meet me at my car at 10:30. Mellery: I have to order flowers for the johnson funeral. What is my budget? Correct. Okay, no problem. The visitation is wednesday before the service, everything starts at 11 am. No problem. That should be enough time .
Aric: Good morning sweetheart! No. I didn't manage to get there on time. It was already closed when i arrived ... I'll try. Okey, okey. I'll pick it up today, promised. Ariel: Good morning. Have you picked up the parcel from the post office yesterday? Can you do that today? Listen, i really need that parcel. And it's been lying three days already! Tq.
Joanne: Girls i am taking a few days off next week. What's wrong? I am going to spain with my fiancee. You will do perfect without me monica, don't worry. Well i am not cancelling my trip. Yeah, and if you need anything last minute you can always call me. Elisabeth: Oh you lucky girl !! Are you travelling somewhere ? : *. Yeah monica, is something not okay? Exactly, we can handle that honey. You worry too much. Everything will be fine : *. Monica: Next week? Are you sure? Well we have this two big presentations with clients next week ... I am not sure ... the 3 of us worked on this project, this won't look too good if you are absent. Maybe, but i think rachel will feel the same way. I know, i wouldn't dare to ask you, i am just a little worried ...
Maggie: Hey david, what's up? Same. Hey, i just got a text from nick asking if we wanted to go to comic con with him. Be honest though, don't you think it would be kind of fun to go? Well, i'm thinking of going ... Yeah, i think it would be kind of fun. I'm not into it, but i thought it would be fun to go this year. Yup. Yup, i'll be wonder woman. See? It'll be fun. Not even as superman? I'll call nick to get all the details. David: Nothing much, you? Oh no ... it's that time of the year again. No! Lol i would never go. Really ? ! ? ! ?! I'd never imagine you're into that stuff. Are you planning on dressing up? Really ? ! ? !? Oh man, i kinda wan na go now. I'm not dressing up, though. Mmm, that doesn't sound bad.
Michael: Yeah. Where do you have it now? I'm quite happy with barclays, they don't charge me anything, the service is great and i like the staff. What? Really? Barclays offered me a credit card after three months, i think. I didn't take it as i don't need it and i don't want it, but it was never a problem to get one. Don't dwell on it, just close the account and come to barclays or nest, i've heard they're ok too. Anne: You have an account with barclays, right? Is it ok? I'm thinking about changing my bank. Hsbc, they were the only one who actually let me open an account when i arrived to the uk. It's time for a change, especially after all those scandals. I wanted to get a credit card, but my request was declined. See, that's what everyone's telling me, i don't get hsbc's policy.
Marie: Food first. Grace: Girls, i'm in the ballroom, come here. Lol. Julia: We're at the table.
Prettier: Henry or harry? Susie: Lol why u asking? I'd choose henry. Haha. Angie: Hey stupid question. Which name is. Just thinking about the future with freddie. Can't decide how to name our future baby boy. Lol. I thought so too.
Mila: Have you heard from anna recently? I just worry about her. She hasn't contacted anyone since 12th october. Not yet. I talked to her father and he said that anna had warned him that she would disappear for a few weeks. It turned out that she has some serious health issues and she needed some time alone to figure out, what to do. I'm just afraid she's going to hurt herself. She was so depressed, when i saw her for the last time. What if she needs support or someone to talk with? Wyatt: No. Why? Oh, this doesn't sound good. At all. Has anyone called the police? Well, then we should respect her wish and leave her alone. If her family is not concerned, then we shouldn't be either. Anna must have some hard time, let's give her some space. Then she'll call .
Conrad: Hello there. Did you ask yout mom about the letter? Kk, open it, its an invitation. You coming? Thanks, see you there. Donna: Wait imma ask her now. Yes, we got it. Was delivered yesterday. It's very old fashioned of you to send wedding invitations by post. But also romantic. Yes of course! Im so happy for you!
Louis: Fab! Is jane with you? Can you ask her if the's been to the post office? Ok. Ok, thanks - tell her she's great. Some stuff i translated from polish years ago for a web site that they're going to publish in book form now. They had me check that old translation and i had to change or correct a lot of things. I made it in 2012 ... when i re-read it after many years i was horrified and decided to make a huge number of corrections. Fabian: What? Yep. Ok, gim me a sec. Yes, she went there before midday and sent your letter. What was in that envelope again? Ok. How old was that translation? I understand that perfectly !
Assistant: D. Emma: Hi jacob, good good, can't complain. Hm, no, i moved to london a month ago. Work, my company just opened a branch here. I'm the boss .. boss '. It alrighti'd say. What do you do these days? And what do you do for living? Shut up ! ! Jacob: Hey ems, how's it going? You home right now? Really? Study? Work? And you're the boss? Haha good enough!

Philip:  Look they published my article! Haha, i srsly doubt that! But it's so cool to see it printed! Jane: Wow, great! You'll become a celebrity soon! And in the new scientist, who would ever think ?: D.
Bryson: Are you going for a rammstein concert next july? Yeah, you didn ; t know? I think so. I bought mine 2 weeks ago and i spent more than an hour trying to get them, the system was so overloaded. Maybe someone will be selling later one, if they can't attend? Yeah but you know it's priceless to be. Kevin: Rammstein is playing ?! No, i didn't, fuck ... the tickets are probably sold out? Crap ... I am so mad right now ... just checked the ticket site and they are all gone. The price will probably be fucked up though lol. You are right : /. There: D.
Amanda: The tutorial office is closed. I forgot about this meeting. I will wait until it's over. It's better than coming 1 hour late. Glesny: Yes we are at a meeting. No worries, you didn't miss much. Kelly: Room 36. As you wish. Anyways the meeting is almost over.
Richard: Hi guys, i feel horrible today again. I don't think i will come to the party. But what doctor? Not really. But can you recommend anybody? It covers everything, but only 80 %. Thanks! Susan: Richard, you should go to the doctor with it. I'd just go just to an internist. Do you have any pains? I know a very nice woman in the city centre. Do you have a private insurance? Does it cover this kind of things? Ok, that should not be a lot. I'll send you her number as soon as i find it. Jessica: I've told him that for a week! Go to an internist, tell her/him what's going on and we will all be calmer.
Brian: Have you got a tent? Ok, so take it. Mine is for 3, but it's relatively small so it's better to have one extra. Nothing special, just regular camping. And sth warm coz it can be cold at night .. Stuff: Sleeping bag, pad, food, water. Andrea: Ok, so tell me what's the plan? What shall i bring with me? Yes, but for 2 ppl max. What else do i need? Ok, so i don't need any climbing stuff? Nope, no climbing this time, just. Relax: D.
Gonzo: I'm already here. Right int he middle. I know. Should we meet later then? Then let's try to meet somewhere. Next to the police line maybe? Haha. I don't think there's gon na be trouble. Not yet at least. They usually don't start the real deal until 8pm or so. More or less. Martin: I'm at the demo. U coming? Where? It's gon na be difficult. There's a shitload of people here. Later when? Don't know what time this thing ends. My favorite spot. How do you know. So we have another 45 min?
Mary: It's sad. I can not trust anyone. Erick. I told him something confidential. I especially told him to keep it for himself. Last week i met jordan and he asked me about it. I. How does he know about it? And then he said that it was erick that told him. Indeed. Yesterday i met cindy and she also raised this issue with me. Again, erick told her. I'm sure now everyone knows. People talk. It's not compromising. I just wanted to keep it a secret. Thought: How is it possible? Anne: Who disappointed you? What did he do? What an asshole. I haven't heard anything compromising about you.
Marianne: What? The accident? Jack: Whose fault was it? Yes. Phillip: Mine, unfortunately.
Edward: Can you give me a hand? I'm looking for a good present for angie. For her b-day. That's a great idea. Shame it's taken ; ) do you know what she likes? What's that? Oh. Did she mention anything specific? Well, thanks anyway. I'll dig into it. Geraldine: Sure. What do you need? I got her a basket of lotions, perfumes, soaps and all that stuff. Not really, no. I've heard her talking about manga. Japanese comic books. I don't think so. Sure. Whenever .
Grace: Are you okay? Oops sorry i will keep it in mind ( -. Carter: I dont wan na nag you honey. But today i slipped on the floor. Could you mop it if you dropped something?
Sean: Hi! How is it going? Fine as well. How is petersburg? Why? Any examples? Lol. Hahaha. How awkward! That's so common in eastern europe. Anyway, let me know when you're back, i'll be glad to listen to your stories of russia. Take care ! Louis: Hi, everything's fine, you? Strange. Very strange. I mean it's beautiful but people are somehow strange. Yesterday i was in an internet café at there was a guy openly masturbating. Yes, and nobody said anything. Very, they are also quite cold in general, rarely smile. Seems so. I will!
Katy: Let's wait till 4, if nobody comes then we won't have to be here tomorrow. Jeff: Smart ! Mia: We should leave before 3.
Stephen: Oh no, what happened? Yes, like this realisation you're not accepted by your partner. Han: Very unexpected. Sad, sounds serious. Ross: I know, he mentioned it. Buti've no idea why. He said something like : `` peter didn't like who i am ''. Which does not change the fact that it may be very difficult for them. Guto: Guys, be careful when talking to richard. He's not with peter anymore. So maybe it's good they broke up. How long did they stay together? Ross : 3 years at least. Right, a piece of life is gone ...
Tarja: Ok guys, when are we meeting? I'm sick of sitting at home. When are you working tom? How about you chelsea? Cool, we're in touch then. Jenny: I'm in, buti'm free eiher on friday or on saturday. Couldn't be more. Tom: Heeeeeeey it depends causei'm working. Wednesday, thursday and friday. I'm totally in gurl. In: D. Chelsea: Hi ! ! !!

Tom: Where is the `` sala del capitolo ''. Ok! I know. Thx. Kevin: It's in the main building. Martin: The one with the huge round table.
Chris: What are your plans now for halloween? Just gon na stay in? Fair enough i never used to do anything for halloween. I like it. At least you ’ ll have somethinf worthwile to remember. Nick : < file. That ’ s quite surreal. Hopefully your future halloweens will be more upbeat lool. Good night loool. My friends came back down from the home. I went as arthur. I changed my name for that night. I don't know exactly. Sometimes i like changes . Nick: Yeah. Nothing special. In poland we actually don't celebrate halloween and don't do all this dressing up, pumpking curving and so on. On november 1st we just go to the cementary with our families and after that spend time together. Cementary in the night. And how was the club yesterday? What do you mean? Why is it so?
June: Yeah i looked out the window and thought today can piss right off. Lucky you. I just about managed to drag myself into work. Not sure if it is more brave or stupid. Possibly a bit of both. Lol. You're lucky cause you can afford to take the time off. I wish i could. Have you ever tried taking anything for it? Yes. Poor you! Lol. Gina: I can't be bothered to do anything today. The weather is dreek. I thoughti'd call in sick and take the day off work. Having a netflix binge on the sofa. Brave. I wish it was spring. Really can't seem to get myself motivated for anything when the outside world looks like this. Still doesn't make it any better though. The winter depression that is. You mean the usual compendium of prozac or derivatives thereof? Tried. They don't work. If anythingi'd say they make it worse. Yeah poor me. I guessi'll just have to wait until march to emerge out of my winter cave.
Paul: I'm dying here! Take me home! You don't even now how boring ... Julia: Boring lecture? I can imagine. Julia : 2 more hours and you're done for today. Hang on !

Evline: Why? Mostly in his age people don't need braces. That sounds like long time. And it must be uncomfortable. Dentists make money everywhere. Your teeth? Then why didn't you go and check them? Well i have not that many days left to live. Fala: Rafal needs braces to straighten out his teeth. His pangs are sharpy, when you see him you saw them, right? I thought it is genetic but it turned out that his other teeth are not in place and he didn't use his fangs. That's why. He asked the dentists if there is any other way not to have braces but all of the dentist he met said the same thing. First braces to support and his teeth in place for 2 and half years. And after that additionally the other one for 1 and half years. He said. That's what i was thinking about .. And it costs a lot fala : 2000 dollars and +. And i became worried about my teeth. Cause i feel a bit pain in my teeth. Cause it is scary. Mum, you should regularly go to the dentist. What are you talking about? Life starts from 60 's.
Alice: Hi joanna! How's things? Yeah, its shitty ... I work for tmf now. I saw the new office last week. It's horrible. Very big open space .. Yeah, that would be cool ! Joanna: I'm ok, spring is coming. How about you? I have some news about you from mariusz, about work. Again. I heard. Yeah, mariusz told me. But i have another student for you. My best friend.

Bentley: Are you coming home anytime soon? So when are you planning to visit us? Only 2 days? But why? You haven't been here since holidays. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any preferences concerning food? Omg, you resign from so many delicious foods! So what do you eat? Stones and grass? Okay, i respect your choice! Eat and do whatever you want. June: I'm afraid, i am not. I will come home for christmas, but i will stay only 2 days ... I'm no longer a student. I've got ta work. It's the end of school life. I'm vegan, so i won't eat any meat or anything of animal origin. In addition, i haven't been eating sweets for a month now and i want to stay sugar-free. Yeah, exactly. That's all i eat. I really hate this question. I eat many delicious things and i don't consider it as resignation. Thanks .
Marion: Hi! Just came back from my holidays. Greece! Well, we went to athens for a week to do some sightseeing and then for another week to crete. Pretty crowded, but nice. We visited some museums, some archaeological sites and of course the acropolis! Oh, very much! We're actually thinking about going back there next year. That would be fun. What about it? That was more of a resting place for us. Lying in the sun, swimming in the see, partying all nite. I'm not .: P i just liked the atmosphere and the ppl. Sure! Lots and lots!  What ?! Rotfl. Oh, we met her on one party and instantly became friends! Robert: Oh, so cool! Where were you? I envy you! Always wanted to go there! What did you see? How was athens? Surely you can say more ; ). Did you like what you saw? Hmm, i thinki'll come with you ; ). Ik ; ) and what about crete? What did you do there? Partying? You? I didn't think you were a party animal ; ). Take any photos ? ; ). Show me then. Oh that's so beautiful! Did you change you skin colour ?! Ur so evenly brown ! ; ). And in the third pic, who's that? I have to go to greece ...
Horse: D. Kate: I could eat a. Love u! Haha. I'm getting into a bus. On my way. Jim: Great. U hungry? Sandwiches and tea will be ready. I k. C ya. Now: D. D. Know: 
Sharon: Hi, karl. Not that i know about. Any particular place? Indeed. I hear they have diamonds on sale this weekend in dubai. What do you say, karl ? Karl: Hi, sharon. Do we have any plans for the weekend? I was thinking, that we'll go somewhere this time. I was hoping you might come up with something.
Abraham: I'm home !! I found one huge one. I just vacuumed the whole place. Thanks again for a great weekend ! ! Daniela: Yay! All ok then? Found any bugs? No way ! !!  Hahaha. Good luck.
Anna: I am so fed up with the carpet. Nothing much, i am just really fed up with the carpet. No, just my carpet, pretty much anywhere in the house. All of the above. I was thinking i could maybe drink a lot of wine and then i won't be fed up anymore. Always! Bring some wine! Yeah i can't be bothered to go to the shop and need an excuse! Chay: What happened? Any particular carpet? Colour/texture/cleanliness? Anything in particular? Gosh, you sound fed up indeed. What are you going to do about this? Move out? Replace carpets? That could work. Definitely cheapest option. Do you need help? Drinking? Was this a really cunning trick to make me come over with wine? Chapeau! Chay : < file.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. Frankly, i don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility. But do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. I'm just afraid we're gon na lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gon na turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours. I don't know man, i like things the way they are right now. Yup, i can stay a bit longer. Jessie: I'm torn actually - i get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but i researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. So what do we get from it really? I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually. Well ... i could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work. Fine by me. Ron: I might be lacking the context here. The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there? And there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association. It's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding. I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so i won't be able to help, buy ify'all agree it's a good idea, i'm going to support it. As well. Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea? Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example. These are exactly the kind of things that i wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person. Yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. Maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. For example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association. I recall two as well. Association is not a business, we're not gon na start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association. As this was my idea, i can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly. Steve? Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is monday after the meeting ok for you all?
Amy: What is important in life? If you have money you can always have sex. I think love is more important. You can not buy it. Laura: Sex and money. Naah, love makes you suffer. I don ’ t want to suffer anymore. I want to be a rich bitch who gets amazing orgasms for breakfast .
Ian: Are you in catania right now? John: We're both here, in the same house we were last year. Nice ! Johnny: Lovely as always.
Annie: Oh i dont. You know what to present? This is a nice one. Too late paul xd. I will be with you oleg. Paul: I don't have a pair either. Oleg: Hey. So i am doing a presentation. And just realized that we have to be in pairs. Anyone doesn't have a pair yet? Yeah. I have that environmental case. With ellen brockovich. Okay paul : ☹️.
Helen: Yes. My mother has all the important information i ’ m sure she will be happy to share it. At the beginning it was shocking news but now they are both very happy waiting for the baby. I ’ ve never seen angela so happy. She never complained. And how about you? How was your christmas? Do you have any plans for the new year ’ s eve ? Stephanie: I heard that angela is pregnant ! !! Tell me more. Is it a new love? Did she want it? Is the father of the baby happy about it? Do they want to be together? I ’ m sure your mother doesn ’ t know the answer to these questions…. Nice. And how about the father? Does she have a good relationship with him? Does she feel that he ’ s the right guy?
Liam: Timebreak? Hurry up! I'm fed up ... Oliver: In the lobby in 10 minutes. Finishing my paper !
Bruce: How are you, deb? Maybe that's not the best thing to ask but ... i'm worried about you. Ah. That's so stupid, really, coz where are you supposed to get experience if everyone wants you to have experience already. What are you talking about ?? It's fine, i know you've been going through a rough patch. I wrote coz i really wanted to know how you've been, you don't have to force yourself to act happy. Don't mention it. Oh no, please don't cryi'm here. You know you can call me any time, don't you. Debra: Hi, bruce. Yeah, i'm ... so-and-so, i've had better days bruce : /hug debra : /hug. It's just that ... mum is still unemployed and so am i, i'm trying to find something but it's not that easy. I have no job experience and they usually want that ... Yeah ... Mum isn't in the best shape either, dad's death really took a toll on her and she's not young any more, so i don't know if she'll be able to find anything. Sometimes everything feels really hopeless ... Sorry, i'm not the best person to talk to these days. Thanks, bruce. I'm not sure i can express how much i appreciate the fact that you're here for me. No, it's a big thing to me ... actually, not too many people have talked to me recently, so i was a little lonely. I think i might cry, i'm sorry. I know ... it's not entirely bad tears, it's also becausei'm happy i have you. I'm just kind of emotional bruce : /hug. Thank you, really. Yeah ... I think i should eat something ... thanks for writing to me, i'm feeling a little better now.
Amanda: Claudette is such a bitch !! And this one is the. Himself ... Dunno everybody is passing them around. But she's a bitch she deserves it. She seduced him. Petra: You didn't see the pictures ? ?? I thought everyone got them ... amanda : < photo. Best: Amanda : < photo. Lillian: What did she do? Omg. Is that thomas? This is so wrong.

Anyway i hope the new season is as great as the first one even without the original showrunners. We just have to wait and see.
Betty: Sure, what up. Lol, what? Gosh, u're unbelievable! Just give it a chance, would ya. Kate: Ugh .. betty ... U there? I think i wan na drop out. I hate it here, they know nothing about design ... What? Betty : < file.

Tomorrow: D hahaha. Jake: That's a sweet ride, but not my budget unfortunately. Yeah. Maybe i will consider getting a loan hahaha, well actually this model was one of my favorites. If you will sell it for less than 10k i will be there. You will probably get a lot of offers like this. It looks really nice so it will definitely sell soon. They are quite popular so don't worry. Mark:  That's what i thought looking at your post. It doesn't hurt to ask though. Cool, well i took a loan for new one because i needed something safer, bigger. Haha, wife won't allow me xd. For sure, so far some people called in the last 2 weeks but noone is seriously interested. Hope so. Anyways: P.

Rita: Didn't take breakfast with me, is there sth in the cafeteria? Really? Thanks! Lina: Blee, the food there is awfull, i will give u a sandwich. Sure, have 2 of them.
Alice: Everything will be fine. You have great ideas! You still have the whole afternoon, keep your chin up! Focus on one aspect, and take a position, do not be afraid of a discussion. Maybe on class? Sure, class is always the most difficult and controversial. Exactly! Do not be afraid, the worst is to be mediocre. I think you should give as short an introduction as possible. Then get to your examples, things from your research! Of course, they are the best, the most original and new. That's what you're about! And fuck the theory! Nobody cares. Sure, i'll be honoured. Bob: Tomorrow is the panel : /. No, i haven't done anything yet, it's going to be a disaster. Thanks, but i really don't know what to tell them. What aspect? Or gender ... or race. But maybe this is the point - to provoke people? Do you think i should talk more generally or give some examples? And what then? I am not sure. Maybe you're right. Hahaha, ok, will you read my outline? Thanks !
Albert: Hi honey. Is there anything wrong? Oh you scared me to death. Its fine. I can be there at 8. I miss you too : *. Bunny: Hi. Can you come here now? No. I just miss you so much. Im sorry .. Thank you. So be sooner < 3.

If you wait until 1 o'clock, i could join you. Cool. Usual meeting point? See you then! April :.
Jody: I hate ironing! Especially shirts! My hubby uses like 5 shirts a week! And all i do is iron them! Wouldn't even let him near an iron! Well, mostly because the last time he did ironing, he burnt my favourite shirt and two of his own. Have no idea. Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know. Yes, i have an iron at home. Don't need to borrow it from the neighbour. What's this? So, how does it work? Sounds too good to be true. Rly? Can i come over someday and judge for myself? Sure will! Thanks! If it works as advertised, surely will! Tomorrow around 2:00? See you then. Lynn: Me too! I know, that's a pain in the neck! Can't he do it himself? Why not? How did he manage to do that? Have you tried an ironing machine? No, like. An ironing machine. Useful with shirts, t-shirts and similar. Not sure. Probably hot air goes through and pushes the material out so that it also irons it. But it isn't! I have a similar one and it actually works! Sure! I'm doing the laundry tonight. If you have time tomorrow, pop in for a quick coffee ; ). No problem! Hope it makes your life easier. Believe me! It does! Sure. Will be waiting. Bye . This: 
Sorry:  Anna: Thank you! If you could please offer your edits and comments on last week's topic, i can get started. Sure,.

Paul: Why not, what movie? Oh, i've seen it already ... Gregory: Wan na go to the movies? Climax?
George: They always have vanilla, stupid! Rocky road! Stacy: What flavor do you want if they don't have vanilla? I can forget your ice cream altogether, asshole! Okay. Was that hard ?
Harvey: Do you really wan na go to that skiing resort? You are aware it is a three hour drive to get there right? That's a loooooooong drive! That's a very generous thing to go. Thank you very much! Tomorrow is saturday and i work every other saturday. And i need to work tomorrow. Let's either do it on sunday or next saturday. Of course not ! !! I like them a lot! Except for me! I've been skiing since i was a child. I grew up in the snow and used to ski all the time. I also used to play hockey and skate. We can do all that next week ! Carol: I know i know. And sincei'm not doing any of the drivingi'll pay for the gas : -d. And snacks ! !! How do you feel about going tomorrow? Next saturday works out better for me. Do you mind if i invite jon and amanda to tag alon? They've never been skiing before. It will be a new experience for all of us. Really? I thought you'd never done it. That sounds like fun.
Ricardo: Fuck. Hmmm, yeah, you might be right. In any case it's only one negative review by a silly old woman, i don't really think it'll ruin our lives. When life gives you lemons, change your name to juan. Jan: Guys ... the landlord has just published her review of us. It's i-n-s-a-n-e. Omg was i? Well then, i'll write to her and apologise, perhaps she'll change the review? Yeah, i think you're right. Also, i assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers? Well, it looks like we deserve the shitty review and there's not much we can do about it, can we? I feel like it'll totally ruin mine.  Aaaaaaaaaaaa. Emma: Give me a sec. I especially like the bit about janek being `` sombre '' and `` exceptionally rude ''. Hmmmm well, i bet it's one of these cultural differences ... as a spaniard she probably expected you to become her best friend and have a friendly chat about the weather ... instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment ( which i would also do, but i understand if it was too much for her ). I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. Again, i don't really think you've done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-spanish behaviour. Fuuuck. I actually might have left some ... i was so tired in the morning i didn't even think about that. I'm so sorry guys. Change your name to juan asi've been suggesting for years. And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa.
Ashley: Sure. Y? Sure < file. Jill: Did you do your homework for tomorrow? Can i copy it? Going out with my parents tonight and won't have time to do it.

Claire: I ’ m so stressed ( (. I ’ m worried they will give a weird subject or that i will be too far away and won ’ t hear the recording. Yeah ... I don't thinki'll be able to sleep tonight. Where should we meet tomorrow? Vince: Me too… i ’ m still revising. Thanks for this, i feel much more confident now. I just want it to be over. Nate: I hope it will be easy. Me too ... i listened to all the recordings in the book, but i don't thinki'm ready. I'll wait for you at the entrance. Paula: What ’ re you revising? You can ’ t learn a language in one evening. It ’ s a language test, you either understand it or you don ’ t. You're all ready, just stop panicking. You're acting like it's the end of the world ; ). Vince, go to bed, you need to have a clear head tomorrow.
Charles: How much are you paying for your gym? Ok, same as i, how much is it? Jane : 50 quid per month. I knew it! My gym is a total rip-off. Jane: I have a membership, open with 24/7 access. But there's a swimming pool. How much are you paying? Charles : 80! But i don't have a pool. Bit much, i think.
Brenda: Soo we ’ re fucked, what now? Just put it back and turn it so that they can ’ t see it. Just do it, they ’ ll realize it later! Then well pretend we don ’ t know anything. Wendy: I broke mum ’ s vase ; [. It ’ s not completely destroyed, but there ’ s a huge scratch. Omg. Haha ok xd.
Donald: Okey dokey. Corbin: Make sure to bring id with you. Buck: No worries.

Indeed: D. Olivia: Yes. No olivia : 30. Jesus, i thought it'll never end. It wasn't awful if that's what you're asking, but ... i don't know, i didn't feel anything? He texted me already and wants to meet. No if i don't like him ... and i kind of think i don't. He was nice and all, but ... It's so shallow ... i feel really bad about it. Thanks dear. What should i do? He asked me out again. Yeah, he ’ s nice, i ’ m not sure if not too nice ; ). I said i ’ d go out with him again. Ok, he suggested we can go to the cinema again…. Maybe i ’ m weird, but come on, i don ’ t feel like going any more. Carrie: How was it ?: D. Or is it still going ? ; >. Whoah, good! Waiting for more, you got me curious. That bad? I understand, it happens. But will meet again? He must have liked you then! That's good. You don't fancy him? I think you shouldn't - what guy would say the same? We both know they wouldn't talk to a girl they don't find pretty so don't beat yourself about it. I ’ d give him another chance. Sometimes there are no sparkles in the beginning. But you said you like talking to him. Hahaha, we sure are from the same family. Very creative. Eh… go out with him once more and if you ’ re bored again just tell him no .
Tonight: L ill tell him though < 3. Caitlin: Hey, could you tell erica thati'm not going tonight? Thanks caity x. Cheers! Laura : ; ). Laura: Its david.

Ok, i'll book it ! Madeline: Wow, why not? I've no idea what they're playing these days. No, it's very banal, for children. Do they have anything more contemporary? That's way better. I've heard of him, i believe he was ukrainian. Let's try it, something new.
Rob: Hey joe, are you coming in to work today? Hehe. Don't sweat it, i'll cover for you. Hopefully, the boss doesn't come into the warehouse before you come. No prob, see ya when you get here.

Maria: Where are we meeting? And then go to eat together? It's pointless, tell her we will meet at the restaurant. I won't go to the library to pick up nora, from my place it's 30 minutes by car, it's stupid. Exactly ! Leo: Nora wanted that we meet at the library. I think so. Why? Ok, right. So at the restaurant at 8pm?
Charlie: What happened? So what? How nice and generous of her ... sorry, need to puke. Jeez, rich people are insane sometimes. Andrew: You know what? My boss is ... it's beyond words. She said that a friend of her son's is coming to her son's birthday party. Well, she said that it's a good and democratic thing to invite a boy from a `` poor '' family to the party. But that's not everything, she said that she doesn't want the other boy's mother to prepare a cake or any other food because `` she will use low quality products from the supermarket ''. Insane indeed ...

But at saturday is our performance ... Don't you think conductor will be angry if i didn't show up? Okay so tell himi'll be practising at home. I'll do everything, i promise.
Kerry: She said no. She said she ’ d had doubts for some time etc. Guy: What hows that possible. I ’ m sorry man. I ’ m sorry, you wan na come over tonight ?
Kim: No, but i remember the case. I think it's dangerous. She said that she saw beheaded bodies and it did not `` faze her at all ''. But if she had stayed in the uk, her children wouldn't have had suffer this fate. Andreas: There was a similar case in austria at the beginning of the war. But, honestly, i can not relate to their problems. So much naivety and stupidity. Jeff: So she wants to come back now? But maybe she has changed her mind, she was only a child when she left. Elena: Have you read about the british teenager that escaped to syria in 2015?  Apparently. But she also have no regrets. That's what the ministry replied. That she's ideologically dangerous and could even radicalise others. Insane. Althoughi'm very sorry reading the story how her children died of malnutrition. It's a good point. She brought it upon herself. Also true ...
Meg: So, i've got a new job. But i won't take it. Well, i came to the conclusion that'd be just a short-sighted remedy for my problems. I need to keep searching with some plan. No, marketing department at a publishing house giving out materials for teachers. It wouldn't be any progress for me. It'd a step back in fact. Yes, i am, i need something more challenging, something i really want to do in life. Al: Really ?! Congratulations! Where, what, how? Ah, why not? Is it the one you said they wouldn't give you good money? But was it also an interactive agency? Alright, i see, but are you sure-sure? That's the trickiest part ...
Shut: P. Neal: Yes, it hurts like hell, btw how do you know? Oh ... he never keeps his mouth. I know, just kidding. Diana: I heard you had your tooth removed. Your brother told me that. He didn't do anything wrong.
Alex: Why, mom? It ’ s sunday! So? I forgot. Oh, yeah. You bet we go. But why? I'm glad sunday is only once a week. He'll forgive me. Mom: Honey, are you coming down? We ’ re going out! Exactly, honey, it is sunday. You know what that means. Sunday means we go to church. Don ’ t push it. Put on the coat, let ’ s go. To show respect to god and others. I hope god didn't hear that. I know he will.
Mindy: I don't know mom, i didn't drive today. Carol: Where are the car keys? Very nice ... ordering dinner tonight then, your cost kiddos. Pater: Damn, i have them with me, forgot to take them out ; /.
Nathan: No worries, everything all right? Oh. Let me know when you're nearby, i will order one for you. Leo: I'll be late, sorry mate. Got in a fight with michel. The usual. I need a beer. Cool !
Jack: Hello teacher! Are we meeting in the evening? John: We are, what time? Jack : 20? Ok.
Damian: That's hilarious, where did he learn that? That's epic! Is that in your garden? Looks great, is that the new pool? Clever. Did you get a good deal from that jack guy in the end? Can i have his details? My parents are wanting to have their garden done. Cooli'll pass it on, thanks dude. Will:  Blatantly takes after his dad. Yeah we have had it done up. It's one of those temporary pools. I can't face the hassle of a hole in the garden ... Yeah he sorted me right out, decent bloke as well. Defo.  Hold on.  That's the one. He's best with his mobile. No worries.
Hillary: Have you seen the news? They said over 20 people died so far. I'm not leaving the house. I've never experienced so low temperatures. George: Yeah. As usual in these kind of circumstances. The most vulnerable people are affected the most. Me neither. Jerry: That's insane. Incredibly cold. That's so sad. Stay warm guys.
Jake: Some ppl just luv adrenaline. But they also need some talent. Pete: People are awesome. I've just watched a youtube vid that shows incredible stunts ppl do. Free fall, skiing with kite and other frickin ' acrobatic stunts. I envy them these abilities and money to accomplish their dreams ...
Francis: Hey. Listen, i need a favor. Some time ago clarissa and i decided to renovate our house. You might know where am i going with this. I do most of the work by myself, but i need someone to help me with heating installations. Gas. Not for free of course. What do you say? You can stay at my house for the whole weekend if you wish. That would be the best. Can i call you now? Alright, i'll call you at 6 and we'll talk details. Thank you reynold. Your help will be much appreciated. Reynold: What is it? Oh i get it now. Gas or electric heating systems? I'm only free on the weekends, this will take three days tops. I can come on friday evening and see what ya have there. Great. Should be all done on sunday evening. Call me at 6, i'm still at work. Sounds good. Alrighty, bye for now .
Amanda: Hun, are you still at the mall? Can you buy some bread? My boy < 3. Well, the summer is coming, i need to get in shape! You know that it's not true, i had terrible thighs ... Shut up! Well, it's not funny, you'd better stop! Oh, and some avocados, please! Nick: Yep. Wholegrain? You're always on diet! Oh, come on, you look great! I love your full body, my sweet doughnut! Come on, i'm joking. Okay okay, just don't get angry ... Roger that !

Ivy: Hey. Why not? Isaac: Hello. Are we still going to the motor show? Okay. Just wanted to confirm.
Todd:  This was on my apt door. Who the f is behind this? It's not. Tiffany found it. Yep. Nah, i don't have any like that. We've got enough bloody cameras in the building. Definitely very odd. Thanks. Not a biggie but still. Why would someone do that? Perhaps. Do you have a camera outside yours? I see. I'm about to drop a couple hammers on the bod and mgmt ahead of the meeting. Will copy all to fb. Definitely ! Julia: What's that? Looks like photoshop. Someone saw and sent you that? Weird. Shenanigans. Cleaning tiffany? You found her! Saints be praised, she lives. Still super strange. Suppose there's no cameras that could help, eh? Sorry that happened. Weird prank? Got the wrong door? I think there's on in the hall that catches my door. Never actually had to pull any tapes so not sure if it even works. Oh yay! Give me notice so i can prepare popcorn first.
Jasper: Where r u? That sounds good. Doctor on call. Yes, i can imagine, it must be pretty exhausting. Well that's a good thing, there is no harm in that. Jada: I'm in islington. I'm waiting to start one of my sessions. Later on i also have two sessions in a private clinic. Howeveri'm not in the mood today, i'm feeling quite tired. I'm actually never really in the mood for the sessions at the clinics, they tend to be more tiring. I feel drained out afterwards. I do enjoy the work, but it isn't easy. I actually took on the extra sessions for the extra money. Ok love, gtg.
Dan: Yeah mate. See you there? Cool, i'll tell matt. Ok? Milo: Hi man, you going footie tonight. Nah, got to go to dentists, braces. Thanks man.
Ava: Yeah, i'm here. Yes, sure. Send me a photo of the letter andi'll take a look. I don't think so. They need volunteers, soi'm sure its positive news! Ok, they are just informing you that they need a copy of your id, before you can start working. We can go together tomorrow. Abigail: Are you online? I need to ask you something. Do you remember when you came with me to the education centre? I received a letter from them today, buti'm not understanding it. Do you think you can help me? I'm worried that they may have rejected my application : /. Yeah, that's true.  Really ?? I'm so happy that's really great news !! Thank you ! ! !
Peter: Did you get the tickets? The tickets are sold out now. No ... I'll try to get one second hand. People tend to resign last minute. Olivier: Me too. Amanda: To the harry potter formal hall? Yes ! !! Did you get yours?
Patrick: I'm sure that they'll ask you a question why you're applying for this specific position. You know, they want to know your motivation. Think about it, please. I want you to get that fucking job!  I like working with people. I like advising people. I like selling things. You want to get that job! I see you're in a good mood. Think about your motivation. They're paying lots of money. I'll loose my temper in a moment. I've found some interesting ideas in the web. Because:  James: Hmm ... but i have no bloody idea ... Why would you apply for the position of a sales person?  I'm thinking about it but nothing comes to my mind. Calm down, bro. Good. Now learn them by heart! Patrick :.
Helena: Hi wanda, how is uni going? I see you've started swearing like a typical student! My language got really bad last year! Here too, only with scottish accent as well, it did take me a few months to get used to it! Yep, you didn't move out of west yorks even! I know what you mean! I can't be arsed to peel veg and stuff like that, i exist on take aways and convenience micro meals, not good! I have had one, but edinburgh is a bit posher than glasgow where it's more popular. Do like square sausage and cloutie dumpling, though! You bet! When can you make it? Should be fine! I have got lectures friday mind, you could try a bit of sightseeing, perhaps? Don't start trying to act all scottish, you sassenach! Yes, buti'm an adopted scottish person now. I'd really like to stay on here, maybe do a pgce. Maybe, but it's an ideai've been toying with, convey my passion for history to the young! Well, we'll see, still got over a year to decide! Oh yeah, forgot about that! Anyway, keep me posted about next weekend, can't wait to see you if you can manage it! Bye ! Wanda: Pretty well, but the deadlines are doing my head in, so much fucking work! Yeah, i remember! I was shocked, but everyone does it here! You're a lot braver than me, i only went about 15 miles to leeds. Well, i prefer it! I can even go and work in the petrol station till 10pm and pop home on the late train if i want to, saves me food money to have a day or two of home cooking, plus it's a lot nicer. Have you got i to the famous scottish deep fried mars bar craze? You'll have to initiate me into these delicacies when i come visit. Well, i have two days off lectures at the end of next week and i can swap my shifts around if i do it tomorrow. I reckon i can train it up next thurs if that suits you. I would love to see the castle and the national art gallery, have a wee look round too, hen! Not sure what that means, but you're a yorkshire lass too and you do it! You a teacher! You haven't got the bloody patience to deal with kids all day! Hopefully, the young will share your enthusiasm! Think about it carefully, my sister teaches geography over in brighouse, as you know. She's only been doing it 3 years and she feels burnt out at the end of term! Me too, bye chuck!

Pam: Milton, do you know maybe how is the process of getting a belarusian visa? Oh no! I wanted to search for my family roots. My grandmother was born not far from minsk. I guess so. Do you remember any problems? Sounds very bad. I will. Thanks. Milton: This is quite an annoying process. Do you want to go there for business or touristically? Wow! That's interesting! So you would do some private research/. Then i would check better on the internet. I was there only for 4 days 10 years ago. Oh yes, it's a very corrupted system that one has to deals with. Bribes, strange arrangements, feeling of insecurity. But google it. It may have changed since. Good luck !
Miriam: Hey there! It was so nice to go to see you guys yesterday. Omg seriously! You work on sundays ? ! !! Oh lol so sorry for you. Ofc, i'll be happy to see you guys soon. Meanwhile, i wish brad a fruitful sunday! Brad: Indeed, i had a very good time. Working. Can you believe yesterday i was a happy person? Yeah ... some researchers don't know how to organise their time and they end up working extra hours and weekends. These are the disadvantages of being your own boss - and being shit at it. I'll try and feed on the positive memories from yesterday. We should hang out soon! Thanksssss. Hope: The pleasure is mine. What are you up to today? No. Oh totally!
Ciara: No! I havent even bought a costume. Wheres a good place? Thanks, i'll see what i can pick up. You got everything u need? Mine too. Always tons of fun.

Great, i'll pop over then, give me 15 mins. Ok, sounds great. Hope you've cleaned that bathroom, not like the other night! I was frightened to go in there, i was afraidi'd catch something nasty! Hmm, you were very surei'd come, then! No, i like coming over and i really like staying! Right, i'll just grab a few bits andi'll be there asap. Craig: What you up do now, feel like coming over? Nothing much, feeling a bit lonely, keep me company? You read my mind, then! How's brad? She's touring, as usual. They have asked her if she wants to go on the cruise ship like a couple of years ago, she is considering it. No need, pizzas ordered andi'm well stocked with wine, as usual! Use your key, so i don't have to come down to let you in! Well, i cleaned it earlier, when i got home, just in case you stayed over. You don't have to, or just come and get a taxi back later. That's ok then, cos i like you staying over too! Cool! Can't wait !

Rasha: What happened? Can't be good. I know they do repairs at those big box electronic stores, you can try there. There's a little electronics shop near my house, but i don't know if they repair computers. I don't know. T & t or something. The next time i head out, i'll check for you. Or better yet, i'll drop in and ask them. Yeah, sure. I'm going shopping in a bit, soi'll call you and let you know. Yeah, i don't really need it. You want me to bring it to school? The only thing is that it's quite slow. I finished that last week. You wan na see mine? Don't copy, though lisha : : -o i wouldn't dare.  Thanks, you're a life saver ( like always ). My pleasure.

Kian: Right. What happened to his mother actually? What kind of cancer? I thought it's easy to treat nowadays. Exactly. Martha: Oh no! This story scares me. How can one trust doctors after listening to it? Andrew: Did he manage to see her before? John: Toby's mother died this morning. I don't know, i don't want to disturb him now. She was diagnosed with cancer a few weeks ago. Breast. It seems it was kind of mistake of doctors. She noticed a lump some time ago but they said it was not malignant. Then suddenly it changed. And attacked other organs. Yes, the diagnostics these days are much better than they used to be. But still not perfect.
Vanessa: I'm eating out today mum. Karen: Get downstairs, dinner's ready! Tell dad to come downstairs ! Jim: Coming!
Nigel: Hey, i just saw this bookstore named after a reventlow book? Yeah, that's the one. Have you been? It seems pretty neat. Do u want to go check it out tomorrow? Its not too far from us after all. That suits me. I have to meet tristan for brunch anyway. He did, but he missed being away. Got bored of bielefeld real quick. Not really his scene ...

All of the people in the house ignore my msgs on fb eva almost doesn't live here. I mean guys. What did they say? Because e.g. Michael doesn't give a shit. He doesn't give a shit about anything and leaves dirty dishes. I bought all stuff last time! Soup and `` finish '' to the dishwasher. Can u write to them to buy the things today? Please. All people gon na see that. It's only me writing there. All the others don't give a shit. Not even a single reaction.

Blair: You know nothin ', john snow. He wants to go to the moon. He's creating the first passenger shuttle to the moon. Rly. Unfortunately, that kinda cash doesn't fit into my piggy bank. Apparently they're going to stream the whole thing in hd via their satellites. You really should! If not for work, you can always use it for pleasure. Someone got scared ? ; ). I do confirm that. When you put on the headset it's a little awkward at first, but when you forget about it, virtual reality becomes reality. Remeber, it's not cheap. But it's worth it ; ). Tiffany: Who's elon musk? Nope, sorry. Rly? How much is the ticket? What? How ?! Wow! Amazing! When? Shame. Maybe until theni'll manage to buy myself this vr headset ; ). Really that scary? Where can i buy this? Cheap is not the word that best describes it. Dale: Srsly? Never heard of him? He set up paypal, tesla and spacex. Depends. Currently around $ 35 mil. Bt the good news is that you'll be able to watch it using vr! No one really knows. When they finally build the shuttle and set off, but the date is not known for now. Just don't play horror games. You'll get a heart attack. Tried it once. Nevermind the money. I'm not doing it again. But all other games are fine. And the experiences are unspeakable! The easiest way? Online. There you go.

Thought he just left. Interesting. Left: D.
Tom: Shit. Totally forgot. What are we gon na do? I guess if we do it today there's a chance it's gon na come by then. Do you have anything specific in mind? Okaay, i guess it's affordable if we split. Lem me ask rachel, maybe she'll have some ideas. So she says she likes the ones with the orchid theme and it might be kayla's style too. Rachel says necklace is fine. Ok, if they have some sort of extra fast delivery, i'd choose that. I know, but if we've already decided on this, let's make sure it comes on time. Jeff: You know kayla's birthday is like this friday, right? I wonder if it's too late to order something on-line. Well, i remember she mentioned this jewelry producer she likes. It's nothing too fancy here. But i don't know shit about jewelry and there's just so many kinds. Ok. Cool, so you wan na go with the necklace or something else? Ok, necklace it is. I can buy it, you just pay me back when we meet or sth. May cost more, though. Fine by me.

Let's do this. Ida: Have you checked tesco? Actually, is seems that they have everything there. I'm always like overwhelmed when i get into there. So, judyta, maybe i could pick you up and we'll go to marta together? We could talk about things by the way. Marta: Hey there! Good news, i've got a spare drying rack in my apartment! I don't want money from you. Just come and take it. That'll be one less thing in this already full flat. Yeah, brilliant idea! I want to see both of you here!

Ben: Hello! As i wrote to u i am visiting sebastian this weekend in warsaw. Tomorrow we go to a concert. During the day i would be more than happy to meet you somewghere. First band starts at 7pm. Sounds good. I will talk to sebastian. Concert will be at the voice. Where r we goin to meet? Some ideas? Ok, it's close to the voice. I'll ask sebastian if we manage to be there at 5. So maybe let's meet earlier, at 4ish so john could stay longer with us. Miley: Hi! We could grab a beer in the evening, before your concert. When it starts exactly? Bonnie and clyde? So what do you propose? Deal ! John: I have a free afternoon. We already have sam plans for the evening, so we won't manage to meet you then. I can meet you at 5 but not for long. Sarah: Guys, don't count me when it comes to this weekend ... ; (.
Frank: And? What are they're offering? Anything interesting? What about the prices? Huh, typically, it's better to be a new client then an old one. I'd advise you to cancel the deal and then sign a new one a new client. Of course you can ! Michael: I received an offer from the provider. Not really, that's the problem ; /. I wanted to change my phone for something better with better camera, but they're offering same models. They offer a few bundles and packages, most of them are for new clients though ... Can i do it?

Let's hope you are right!

Although tomorrow we'll be spending the entire day on the pitch so i don't know ifi'll get to enjoy it as much as i would like.

Leu: How are you? Any new development about the house? That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time. It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in poland. He does it from time to time, doesn't he? Not quite. Never saw him really tight. As if slowly killing himself with liquor. But it is terrible. How can you cope with it? Therapy? Nor can i. Poor luisa, poor bill. It is so sad. But you are tough luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, i'd say. Right you are ! `` the beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different . '' do you remember? Luisa : `` then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. Such is life . ''. Luisa: Hello my dear! Sadly not. No news at all regarding the house ( we'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives! That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market. Oh well ... wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had , 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night. From time to time? Regularly ! !! Can't you remember ?! Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples. He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him. I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look i can not do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day. Gim me a break! Can you imagine bill attending an aa therapy like a good boy! I can't. We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, i thoughti'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse ... now it's too late. Yes, i am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if i can't change it. To a degree ...
Gloria: He. You know what, i couldn't stay till the end. I was leaving at around 12 and we had only done a, b and c. Yeah, i heard they finished past 6pm. Well we'd have to sit down. Andi'd tell you everything with details. But in general the new deal is quite good for us. Ok, i'll email you my calendar. And we'll find a window ; ). Joel: Hey how was the meeting? Shit ... Wow. Do what did you agree on? Ok, tomorrow? Ok great.
Vera: Which place? We go to a lot of places lol. Fine tea room on 5th street. Going there? Ok but we should go there again. Ok ! Una: Hey what was the name of that place we went to? The tea shop. Thanks. No just making a list of places for an office party. Sunday?
Felis: My cat is amazing. He woke me up at 3 am. He started to purr and wanted to be pet. I pet him a few times but i was tired. So i stopped and fall asleep again. So he opened my wardrobe and started to pull out my all sweaters : @ craig : < lol >.
Caroline: Do u think professor mulligan would be willing to write a recommendation leter for me? Mmm ... you are right, i'm still going to ask him anyway. Amira: I don't know. He's got dozens and dozens of students each semester. He probably doesn't even know who you are : -/.
Alan: Good for him. The other one wasn ’ t that great. I hope. Why? What did he do? What ? ?? That ’ s not a good start of any relationship. Maybe you should talk to him. Lillianne: My brother met a new girl online. Indeed. Maybe this one will be better. But he doesn ’ t know how to handle girls. He only met her a few times and already gave her a super expensive gift. He has money and he compensates other things like that. But deep inside he ’ s very insecure. I tried but he ’ s so sensitive. It ’ s hard to tell him anything without hurting him.
Michelle: Hiya carol ! !! I don't read any politic blogs. They're all biased : -/. With what's happening in the worldi've been keeping out of the news. I know what you mean. I used to be like that, but i just can't take it anymore, lol. I just read what i wrote, i sound so dramatic !! Hahaha. Danny reads loads of blogs every day. I'll tell him to text you with the best ones later today. Carol: Hi michelle, can you recommend a good politics blog? Really ?? Why? I know. That's why i was hoping you knew of a good one. I've tried to do that but i just can't. I need to know what's happening in the world. Lol, you're ok, i know what you mean. Thanks michelle ! ! !
Ethan: Hey, i'm thinking of buying a smartwatch. I want to have the step tracker. I do, but i don't always have my phone with me, so the final outcome isn't accurate. I'll look into it . Ben: Hey, why do you need it? Don't you have the app in you phone? Yeah, i get your point. They have a wide offer @ best buy.
Janine: I'm sorry for my kids but these places are not for me, so boooring ... I'm doing this for them but ... hoping that nobody is expecting me to have fun ; ) ; ).   At least they seem like it's the time of their lives : ' ) : ' ) : ' ). Yep. Almost! She's 6. Oh yeah, she has a `` boyfriend '' already. And he's not the first. Come on, i had my first boyfriend when i was ... Erm ... Okay, six, but the world was different ! ; ). I don't know ... so far it seems she's in charge here ; ). Mike: Hahaha totally understandable. Is that zoe ? ?? In blue dress. Wow she's taller than jacob? This smile says `` trouble '' hahaha. In a couple of years ; ). Ha ha ha you can't blame genetics ; ). She has two big brothers and her dad is a soldier. How much safer can you get ? ; ). One: O.
Rita: Hospital? Because of a diarrhoea? Calm down, you need to keep him hydrated. Give him one more, sometimes it doesn't work from the beginning. Sandra: Help! Little one has a diarrhoea. My sister's going to kill me. Yeah. I did, he's drinking and i gave him pills but they're not working. Oh god. He's vomiting now. Don't even say that. I'm going to the hospital. Karen: Take him to the hospital. How old is he ? 4? If it doesn't stop you should go to the hospital. Mark: Oh dear. Give him some pills. You sure it's not stomach flu?

Claire:  Fatm just released a new single! You need to check it out! Let me know when you're done, can't wait for your opinion. It is, right ?! I love her so much < 3. Exactly! Her music really is divine, peaceful and powerful at the same time. Hm, not sure, probably next year. Me too, i want her to grow etc., but at the same timei'm afraid she's going to experiment too much. Sophia: Wow! Amazing! Give me a minute. I'm done. And dead. It was magnificent. It's amazing, because ... it's different, but i knew it was her from the very beginning. When's the album coming out? I hope she's going to keep the style of this single. Same thing happened with mumford and sons, can't listen to them any more.

Everyone was off today to recover. Theresa, i ’ m so disappointed you were not with us. But i can ’ t wait to drink with the king! Does amsterdam celebrate it? Yea but a lot of places celebrate. Irish everywhere u know. Just not in amsterdam. Will: How was st patrick ’ s day david? Haha nice! Haha, as far as i know, the king is ready! St patrick ’ s? Nooo. It ’ s something restricted to your culture, i believe. Actually, maybe the irish pubs in amsterdam organized some events. But we dutch people always skip the irish pubs. Only dick in the pubs, no women.

Joan: Me too. That concert gains another meaning now as well. She's probably gon na play some new songs. I don't know. The concert is still 6 months away. Isn't it a bit too early? Thought we agreed the train is our best option. Christine: Omg, omg check this out joan :: D finally! I was really starting to believe she's not gon na make another record. I'm hyping so much right now. Definitely! Btw isn't it about time to arrange those train tickets we were talking about? There's no such thing as too early, my dear ; ) plus we can also consider some other modes of transportation. Okay, let me look into it andi'll let you know what i find .

Sebastian: How many days until end of school year? Marta : 53 days. So many days? Looking forward to the holidays! Marta: You still have some time to buy your swimming suit.
Steve: Hi, what do you think about this display?  Is that a problem? Ok, thanks for the info. I found another one.  Ok, great. I'll order it. I will. Thanks for your help. Bill: Hi! Let me check. Never had the chance to use it personally but the parameters looks fine. Just remember that if you have a geforce card it will not work with freesync. It will work as a display, you just won't be able to activate this technology. I did found something more worrying. There's lots of reviews about frequent bad pixels in this model and issues with the power supply. The reviews for this one look much better and the parameters are similar to the previous one. The only reported issue are faded colors but that's always a subjective matter. From those two i would definitely choose the second one. I don't remember what card you have at the moment. So just make sure you'll be able to connect it properly. No problem.

How about shoes? I see you're in a good mood. I hope to feel the same way after! Thanks. Sarah: Oh hi sorry i just came back, stayed longer to strech a bit more. In general i enjoyed it. Our new instructor took it easy and i was a bit bored. But i love the atmosphere there. Well, you know me, ifi'm not sweating it's not a good training. I've heard you wanted to start moving.

Cause you don't have to hold your breath, i wan na laugh sooo hard. Exactly ! Monica: What's that? Lol, what ?! God, she's one damn attention whore isn't she. How old is she again? Shouldn't it has passed already? Touche! Get a grip! Ang get me more photos, that's sooooo funny. 
Pizza: P. Clive: I've eaten pizza with chocolate and bananas. It was delicious! Hey, jaimie, i remember you ordering hawaiian. Hand: D. Vanessa: Definitely! Pizza is just not meant to have fruit topping. Wow, really? Yeah, it's simply too much ... The world is full of weird people after all ... ; ). Jeanne: There's no worse thing than pineapple on pizza, if you agree, raise your ( virtual ). Usually i like everything that involves chocolate, buti'm not sure ifi'd try something like that. Jaimie: Imo it's not even pizza anymore. It's more like a pie. Yup, i'm fine with pineapple, maybe even some cranberry, but only if there's also enough cheese and meat to counterbalance it. Who the hell makes sweet pizza?

Calm down, kids, no one leaves this house until we decide what to get mum on her birthday. Don't “ dad ” me. Think! What's wrong with that? Last christmas i got her an iron. I like the idea.

What about a spa break? I like the second one better.
Rawiri: Jason hollis yuck ... why even ? ?? Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody i know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well. Daniel: Short attention span. Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces no noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to copd ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases. Ken: Allen so quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues. Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system ..... shocker. Oil .... edibles ... many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it. Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an `` occasional low cumulative '', which could be something like smoking once or twice a month. Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks . ; ). I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint? Btw seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, i'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine. Virginia: Mj users will not believe anything bad. They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard ! David: Jason, i used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and i know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco. I don ’ t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups ( except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up ). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small ... Brian: This is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful ... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates. Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? Max : < link. Tom you didn ’ t watch the video. Daniel probably from pot ‍♂️. Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn ’ t specifically say combing the two, but he says one usually precedes the other.

Missus wants me to spend more time with the kids and to spend time with her. It's either one or the other since i can't see how i can do both. So we end up fighting the whole time. Thought that this is family time thing is supposed to be fun instead it is stressful and annoying. Sometimes i think thati'm not cut out for the family life. Don't get me wrong i do love my kids but all the extra pressure from the wife doesn't help. She doesn't know what she bloody wants. Whatever i do is not good enough. Can't win. Ugh! I thought i could but nowi'm not so sure. Yeah, i think you're right ... i'll think about it.

It's an adventure novel based in the 19th century. Napoleonic times i think. Oh sure! The main character is falsely accused of something a couple of days before getting married. Mark: Hey guys!

Anyway, how's the apartment? Always a plus - i can't imagine living without one now. So what's stopping you? You don't seem all that enthusiastic. Well, then try to negotiate, if she's been renting it already for some time then she knows the game you always set the price higher in case you find someone who would be willing to pay it. And let me know how it went. Would be good to have all the gang closer. Thinking: D. John: Hi, what's up? Lol,. He just lives super close and i thought it was a cool idea to have someone else to go with me. The lady who owns the place actually have us a strange look she looked super old fashioned so you know what she must have been. And we thought it would be funny not to explain anything. But she actually was very polite and never said anything. Well, the flat is a typical rental, so she must have seen some stuff. Well, decent would be the best word to describe it. The rooms are old, haven't been renovated in quite some time. The kitchen is ok - no luxurious stuff but quite nice looking. And there is a dishwasher. The bathroom has been renovated recently - so it's new and in this kind of rental-basic style. In general, if i were buying it for myself it would need a serious overhaul, but as a rental should be ok. The rent is rather high so i would expect a bit more for that money. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah, that would be cool will let you know !

But i may go and stay with her when she's back home. Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere. That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally.

Let me know if you would like to join!

We've had more than 1000 people seeking treatment for bluebottle stings today. I think you can consider it, or at least be very careful. Tim: It's amazing here. Oh no, do you think we should stay home? Ok, thanks ! Kate: Yes, going to the beach right now.

Peter: Ok great. Yes - is that ok? That's a good point! I better go and change. Brilliant !! I had forgotten all about them and the kids love them. Not sure yet - she said she might but think it depends on her son's dad. True, but think that her son's dad is a bit of a nightmare ..... Are you after her? As far as i know she's single. Ancient history. If she comes you can chat to her tonight. Ok let me change my clother - see you soon. Chris: I'm on my way. Are we goiing straight there? Yesi've brought a jumper as it might be cole. I've got some sparklers too. Is tracy coming? I hope so. She's really funny. Shame. She's a great lass.

Carla: I've got it ... My date for graduation. Hope you're coming. Oups sorry. June 4th. Of course, but you have to book your plane. That's why you have to book it right now. Please tell me you'll come. Come, come, please. You could stay home for the week, my roommate won't be there. Yes they will, but they've got friends they could stay with. Aeromexico was the cheapest at that time, but check with delta. I only know the canadian one. Ok! I've to leave you. Tell me soon. Diego: What? If you tell me when ... We've got time. I still don't know, and it's quite expensive. I'd love to for sure. Ok, i'll have a look and tell you. Didn't you tell me your parents would come? What was the company you flew with when you came last month? I think there is some flight comparison websites and also some apps. Don't worryi'll find out. I will. Good night.
Gita: Hello, this is beti's mum gita, i wanted to ask if you were going on the school trip? Yes, beti is the same, they are still only 4 or 5 after all. I know, i could never do their job! I work part time as a music teacher, going round schools. Yes, it really helps to do some sort of work doesn't it! I could never manage full time, though. Yes, but children need time to just be at home and play or just be with family, not galavanting around all the time! Oh yes! She loves animals, we have a few pets at home. Suppose you're right! What time do we have to be at school on wednesday? Hope the rain keeps off, especially if it's outdoors. I'll check their website. Bye, bev ! Bev: Hi gita, yes, milo wants me to come, he's a bit nervous going away from home or school still. I know, still so young! It will help the teachers and tas anyway, they have a lot to cope with! Oh really? I am in marks, part time too, love it there! Oh, i know, gita. My sister's in management and she doesn't see her kids from 6.30am to 6.30pm every day! She is a high flier, but she does miss them. She does do lots with them on the weekend, though. I agree 100 %! Is beti looking forward to feeding the lambs and seeing the baby animals on the farm, milo is very excited. Well, we only have fish, they are pretty but not very interesting! Quite early, i think about 7.45, the bus leaves at 8 and we get to holly farm about 10, i think. Yes, good idea. Anyway, see you weds, gita!
Robert: Ugh, delete him already. Damn girl, delete the bastard. No julia, it is pretty simple. Go and delete him. Srsly? Do i need to remind you he cheated on you? Juliai'm not going through this again with you. And that's it? That ' ok? How's different from two other times? Don't, honey, really. We've been through this. I know you do, but you need to be strong. Do you want to come over? Ok, you should go to sleep then. Don't text him, he's using you, he cheated on you three times now. A notorious twat? Yeah, it might be. You do want what you want but remember i warned you. Ok, now this is pure self-hating bullshit. Don ’ t text him. Julia: Greg just texted me. He's saying he's sorry. It's not that simple, you know it. But he apologised, ok? He's never done it before. People change, i do believe it, maybe he changed. He apologised. I told you - he apologised! He's sorry, he wants to meet. I know, but it's not easy. I think i love him. No, thank you love, but i have to get up early tomorrow. What about greg? I think he has a problem, it may be a medical condition. What if he ’ s the only guy that ’ ll ever like me? Putting my phone away.
Tina: Oh, no! I know, let me think ... I got it !. My sister friend is a cosmetitian, maybe she'll help. I'll call her and let u know, ok? Marry: I broke my nail ; (. U know i have that party tomorrow ! !! Anyone will be good, i'm desperate! Ok, i'll wait, but hurry !
Maddy: What did they say? But does it really matter? I mean the declaration. I think the deadline for payment is 31 march anyway. Paige: I asked them to wait and send the declaration later. Even end of march if it's possible. They want to close it asap cause lisa is afraid she forgets about it later. But i can remind her in a couple of weeks. It's my responsibility after all. I'm not sure, that's what i asked her. Hope she confirms.
